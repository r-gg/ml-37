7051,merchandise was defective
14266,it an adequate speaker for this monetary_value point ll cover the points address in other reviews but the short version be the speaker be fine do not feel like wasted money but if when buy another of these types of speakers it South_Korean_won beryllium jbl it be at least years since ve buy one of these bt speakers and my last speaker was just as loud clear cost less have features that just work and even came with lanyard for easy carry this thing would be hard to carry for person with small hands volume and sound quality it loud in room with no ambient noise my music is mostly rock like metallica pantera white zombi like loud music and for my private office it perfective ll mostly listen at volume so can think but it nice to jam out sometimes at middle volume degree the sound is the best lows volt highs above one-half volume the bass taper off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise you could use this in an environment with ambient noise like warehouse or kitchen but you would need to stay around if you want to really enjoy what is playing after it probably going to sound more like noise than music telephone connectivity is simple for music just push top button but not automatic for telephone calls like it was with my other speaker have in the monetary_value point there are some reviews that screen trouble-shoot this the manual certainly be no aid but it not what necessitate it for just wish it as nice side feature use sometimes with my last speaker like this battery life be fine haven done complete testing on this it Department_of_Energy rich_person pretty significant battery in it for the charge your device option but hour maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music won need it for longer than hrs most of the time so doubt this will come up as an issue for me there an app but it Department_of_Energy very little for this speaker most useful feature be digital transcript of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker thankfully for it main function of bt connect and playing music it pretty basic and simple if you go the path of multiple speakers reads the reappraisal for the app on how to make that work it be not intuitive it series of linear steps which the instructions bash not aid with and if you bash it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews

16990, this speaker sounds great thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass mids highs are clear could be little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is full rich sound and using an eq brings out more of its capabilities jbl quality construction was on the fence about buying this because they went to mono driver but you can really tell difference in fidelity you can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the charge completely happy with it and love the green color one thing do not like is they took away the speaker phone put the speakerphone back that thing like and is missing on this as for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the charge update liked it so much got another one camo these sound great it actually has bass no issues with connectivity or battery this is the best speaker in this class or category there are some that come close but these can be beat the price hike is downer don know what going on there that crazy got these for and that what they should be seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price not cool at they aren that great would expect more at that price

13860,i picked this up so could play the xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide use this headset with my one controller via the plug to play the games enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games the headset fits wonderfully on my ears not too tight not loose however the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home since this is an on the go out in the public headset consider this good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such the headset is light enough to not feel like giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in messenger bag with my phone and controller have thick vinal bag when traveling keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty the sound is adequate on these don expect phenomenal quality sound like high priced headset the audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so can know what direction my team and enemies are in with that being said the glow feature really isn necessary but is very bright and attention getting when plugged into usb port which just runs the led lights in the earphones the bright blue would look really good on live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing for the price paid hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that do through the week ll come back when if they finally break fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability

14496,got this speaker as replacement for my original refurbish ue mega boom play that thing full volume on many occasions and after years although still sounding great feel the speaker might have ruptured spot decide to attempt jbl and didn privation to get the charge because of the monetary_value and tacky huge jbl in the front think old speaker models offer great value as they sound great and are cheaper so far so good with this jbl plenty loud of course haven been make full volume yet because cautious due to my previous ue experience love that it sits on its side and love the color we will see how it will hold up but so far great just as expected from jbl
15357,first of all the speaker is monaural and you need two to get stereo that then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo and there is no app for windows or mac only mobile devices tried an android emulator but you can get to bluetooth that way so forget it the app is crappy too it takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running after while something times out the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re started to make it stereo again the only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don care about stereo sound what waste so good sound or not these are going back both of them 
14589,i brought this speaker as surprise gift for my daughter who hour_angle have the bose companion speakers which she enjoy for years but it was time to upgrade to bluetooth this be our first experience with jbl so make some comparison research between jbl and Bose of which we ve have various products over the years the sound is great color beautiful and size perfect Begin exploitation it as soon as unpacked it initially idea the charge cord or usher were missing due to the separate packaging being camouflaged in the box black on black should be reconsider maybe spine could be added otherwise we are very satisfied with the purchase
8383,item worked well when it work but it no longer charges after months of use usb on keyboard doesn look to work anymore now being months from purchase can return it recommend acquiring different merchandise that may last longer
8279,carry it in backpack at work field applications days week it hard core certainly can take beating

10640,iodine used every manner possible no sound no anything
14095,the sound quality is amaze not to mention the great design all around good headset
11844,great quality earmuffs are soft but after awhile they get uncomfortable would beryllium better if it literature up without having the usb plug somewhere so if using with accountant Don count on it lighting up unless can plug the usb cable somewhere

8574,it powers on and lights up well with every stroke however wasn able to get it to type so returning this keyboard 
14940,there is no audible warning when the battery is low the indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker the way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets charge sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the jbl brand 
8497,ok so there is nothing wrong with this keyboard but nowhere in the description did it say that it had matte finish the keys have slightly sandpaper feel to them that just cannot handle as highly sensory sensitive person every time touch key it is like nails on chalkboard it was great price so decided to use it as keyboard for my tv used very infrequently instead of my primary computer keyboard rather than return it am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use

14766,so originally was introduced to jbl speakers when the charge first came out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been telling any and everyone come across that when ever in question go with jbl so this last christmas someone baught me the jbl flip and was just confused the sound quality the base even the bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song returned no problem only wanted replacement anyway received the second one and again like the jbl look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the charge so after getting refund from the second flip spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the sound that made me fan to begin with if you re just trying out jbl speakers would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the charge models see that the flip and have almost perfect rating on amazon so maybe it just my opinion but believe the quantity all around of the charge is better representative of the jbl brand the battery in the charge seems to drain quicker than the flip but put my speaker threw it passes from the moment turn it on in the morning until am ready to relax in the evening literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth connection no problem at all the sound quality is just awesome love music period believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe or pushes of the button if you re listening to sax or blues guitar albert king for example it only gets better the higher you go garth brooks or lauren daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard man can wait till can get enough for the extreme or the boom box hope this was helpful to someone god bless

4123,first the left mouse chink is not sensitive enough necessitate longer imperativeness than usual for the mouse to register the chink annoyance and bet it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press difficult longer another less significant irritation brand sure you Don bend on the light feature it expression cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually change colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse

10455,this merchandise was little disappointing to beryllium honest for one wish have pay attention to the fact that this is not wireless second the lights don semen on with mic jack which certain it wouldn brand sense to but it really should rich_person just been usb with an adapter otherwise if you Don care about lights it works fine say it better suit for personal_computer gambling since usually there mic jack next to usb port but not for consoles its not the worst just the sound quality is kind of minimal it doesn play music too well it can get loud but then the sound gets shrill age-related_macular_degeneration will induce headach truthfully wouldn bargain this again
12578,the microphone is literally ass rubbish asf when travel to go bend my mic on it didn work and tried multiple times the headset didn work either because of the jack so it rubbish

11478,these headphones are great for gambling with my friends like that the microphone fold up and it plant perfectly with my postscript would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but desire to brand it clear that they aren active noise cancellation headphones

9908,the shock_absorber material is very uncomfortable after few minutes of wear it feel like your ears get hot quickly it look it would have been easy to cover foam ear piece with more breathable material sound quality be great and the microphone look to beryllium perfect but sound quality means absolutely nothing if it is too uncomfortable to wear
16358,overall the speaker is great it be quite bit hefty but that be to beryllium expected with all the rubber keeping it waterproof as well as the remainder of the hardware inside the battery life be pretty topographic_point on with about hour of constant use and the sound be clear and loud very much worth the purchase and if you catch it on sale even more so
5331,stopped working very conveniently after tax_return window have close
2469,while the merchandise looks great it not very ergonomic for me noticed pain in my hands after only few days of usage not great for long time_period use
10142,the design is nice but these headsets aren worth it it use to light up when plugged in and play sounds loudly when first got it but not anymore the sound hour_angle to much bass and staticky from the beginning the microphone would not work despite following the instructions to turn it on so just use it for work to hear notifications when stepped away my computer won acknowledge the headset anymore even when the lights are turned on just prop now

10801,the sound is going in and out shake the headset and the sound reconnects then it gone for the majority of the time terrible quality doesn last long at all 
9317,it fairly bright but you re stuck with the one rainbow color pattern and some of the colors are not as bright as others making typing in the dark harder than it should be the keys are raised up and beveled like keyboard from years ago so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards this makes typing and accuracy little slower some of the keys are placed little weird too the key to the left of the enter key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark this one has the backslash and vertical line as was used to my last keyboard kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be ll likely be replacing this soon

16186,iodine got this speaker to ascent from my old ue boom well would say the only things it Department_of_Energy better is battery life and little more volume when you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effect the highs and the speaker be very directional so it very difficult to discovery location for the speaker that doesn turn it into shrill little squeak box the ue rich_person be much smaller speaker but it has nearly degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles all in all the jbl definitely wasn worth the money lodge with ue

14973,i have always loved jbl products and this speaker doesn disappoint whatsoever for portable bluetooth speaker this thing bumps like can hear it all over bed bath house for an apartment your neighbors might get mad if it too high the battery life is really good with many hours of use even at higher volume levels which drains the battery much faster the sound quality is awesome with great bass and clarity bluetooth connection is quick and easy and you can go pretty far away with your phone in your pocket and it won skip beat and of course it called the charge cuz you can charge other electronic devices with the usb charging plus that dope addition to an already great speaker finally the value for the money spent to purchase this and it definitely worth it price and then some the charge is and got this charge open box brand new for that an insane deal thanks to amazon haha my favorite bluetooth speaker of all time

9925,bought for my son he is not easy on them but so far they are keeping up
14206,you can not turn the speaker off without it devising loud noise they know it annoyance it meant to get you to install the app if you install the app giving up more of yourself to them in other words they Lashkar-e-Taiba you bend it off think it mean to beryllium annoying because even if you turn the volume down to and can not hear anything else it will still make loud noise when turning off they privation you to not be able to turn it off quietly for example when you be listening to some thing in bed and forgot to bend it off and later on privation to bend it off quietly plant fine otherwise the one star is just cause think it fair to penalize such behavior

15293,iodine ve had this speaker for well over year now use it full volume in the shower while its soak moisture and also outside on the patio ve have it connected to my smaller television that move between porch and patio but my sony works better for that due to the sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the jbl app it still expression and plant as good as when first got it battery stopping_point good sum of time and it hour_angle incredible bass for its size especially if its placed against wall or better yet in an inside corner have be very happy with its quality and performance now some negative aspects the battery degree index lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit_of_measurement just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out the base be small compare to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off table if bump speakers are on the ends so you can base it up vertical it does make loud melodic sound when turned off it is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of case attention_deficit_disorder no value is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative suggest getting one without the case the current monetary_value is much much more percentage more than when buy it maybe due to covid monetary_value gouge or just rampant inflation never bargain used merchandise that necessitate construct in battery as person be unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still expression like new

9279,well just saying not sure why the monetary_value be expensive besides the lights on background of keys it be the same basic keyboard you will discovery in the radio section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to support charge the keyboard to guarantee it be fully juiced up so brand sure you bend it off on the bottom so it wont die have not have to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect
516,iodine tried charge the mouse but it didn privation to charge tried multiple cables and nothing light kept switching and when plug the arranger in it didn dad up or acknowledge it

7218,very nice mouse enjoy the colorful addition
9388,only thing don like about it is that the cable include in the package be only for charge rather than for charging and wired use you must use the radio arranger for it to work not huge deal but it would beryllium nice if wire use Washington an option it would make sense
16677,if it werent for the battery life and ability to charge other devices would give this bass response and volume be ok definitely not bad its better indoors than outdoors waterproofness is exceptional spilled cup of starbucks on it and it was unfazed hahaha its lil chunky if ya get big hands its not problem to carry around but it be hefty in weight just wish it had sound

6994,the charging cord is so short and flimsy it won stay connected to both pieces so it is difficult to get full charge the mouse does not hold charge after be left on the charger overnight it is dead within five minutes use 
8602,the keyboard is quiet and the backlight be really nice the keyboard be operation correctly as am typing the reappraisal right now however the design itself has some problems if be to describe the feeling of typing on it it feel somewhat sticky as though am typing into quicksand this be likely because for the design to be quiet it blunts the speed of key press and return to its original position honestly wouldn have minded the noise if it mean better typing experience as it feels like actually expending attempt to type each key the charger port also has issues with the male usb cable plug in it hour_angle lots of resistance and only go in like millimeter with exposed metallic_element when the charge be active all in all think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is godsend but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction

1507,did the occupation
14498,it was gift love it the sound be great rich_person had batch of time to use it but so far it great
17144,great speaker but pre opened box
1835, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work

17221,the jbl charge is great merchandise found it to beryllium initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature rich_person found that the highs aren totally accurate but they re close enough to not distract you from the music the highs are present but definitely aren strong which attention_deficit_disorder to the warm signature the mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device because of this the vocals are great in most songs they are well represent unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear slight distortion from accuracy however the vocals which dip into lower scope sound really good as the speaker does great occupation not to put_option too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic if you listen to high quality hifi tracks you ll beryllium able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound phase as for the infectious_mononucleosis speaker Don listen to the critics of this new execution because most of them either Don know what they rhenium talk about or they are just picking at it because they don like the idea of it you re not going to get stereo by exploitation speakers inches apart like on the last model and as for separation this infectious_mononucleosis speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows the speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the manner to just under full volume ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge xb xb xb extreme onyx and what ve found be that while the highs are bit lacking in certain songs it certainly brand up for it in other departments the bass be very good in the charge the bass notes are represent accurately and it able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can however it worth mention it still no bomber this speaker hour_angle trouble represent very low frequencies the radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don know this doesn sound very good the battery life of this speaker wasn as advertised and found could only get hours on percentage volume which isn bad but be huge deviation from the claim hours after using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers ve actually grown affectionate of this unit_of_measurement and it become my beach plaything don take any critics in this reappraisal too seriously as doubt most people are as critical as me when it semen to audio but this one get my thumb up future improvements would definitely necessitate tweeter and possibly bigger battery

6354,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it

1699,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse 
14475,sound is great and easy to connect to bluetooth does not advise when battery is low

2061,when received this merchandise the first time it have semen broken the entire chink pad Washington nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snap back into topographic_point sent in for replacement and everything Washington all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to December mere eight months the mechanism that clasp the coil wheel somehow snapped apart and the coil wheel is now useless which brand playing games bit difficult as many games use the coil wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement have been sent Washington good despite it not exactly have any kind of index as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the coil wheel mechanisms are gon na snap easily under potentially hard gambling sessions perhaps base_on_balls for something more heavy duty

4367,the receiver is locate at the bottom of the mouse which be theory be great idea however it stuck manner too deep and can get it out without breaking something very sad
12843,after year of using these headphones americium finally departure to get rid of these that not to say it bad it just not for me after year these still work great even though they ve fall too many times to count the audio be fine but everything else be lacking heterosexual out of the box the microphone levels be too low so had to already go to my sound panel and microphone boost it to dubnium could hear my voice nice and clear but it picked up just about everything else in my room not to mention that it also picked up the sounds from the speakers inside the earcups made it impossible for me to play in voice chat with friends because you would hear double the audio now onto the build quality of the headset you get what you wage for americium pretty small person kinda sad and this earphone was still too small for me it hurt my ears and the sides of my heads for dollars it decent set of headphones but recommend you buy something better

2443,after day or the mouse would not work at all it Washington not problem with the connection my computer Washington able to choice up the bluetooth no problem the mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some kind of charger kind of defeats the purpose of radio mouse
11226,the mic doesn even work and there no noise cancelation the mic didn work the first day the audio started film_editing out on the second day
904,i initially really enjoyed this mouse it is good size the battery life is reasonable and sucker for anything that lights up rainbow do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being constant red light however after using the mouse for less than months the scroll wheel stopped working and can figure out why ve tried cleaning it out recharging the battery and adjusting my driver settings with no luck definitely frustrated and because my return window has past not sure how to reach out to customer service 
6787,likes no noise click lights look cool chargeabledislikes chargeable battery life is very short had to turn off every time don use it or else battery runs out super fast within days after months the charging outlet is broken there no way to fix it now can use it anymore safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for long time

8794,after months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard 
10947,so definitely stars here the sould it really good they even fit my big head issue never idea have big ears but these don fit my ears right and after spot they start to hurt slightly just take minute interruption and toilet or something and then back at it play for hour heterosexual the first day can mistake them

3029,the technology is great but ergonomic it be not
13012,headphones came in bag not in box no instructions and no warranty info 
9068,this is good looking keyboard the rainbow colors you see are all you can get so no selection of one color is available although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice not critical issue as said it nice looking keyboard but functionally there are couple of issues that are immediately apparent first the enter key as in the picture attached has notch in it that is shared with the key am constantly hitting the and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages so at minimum it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone another issue seems to be battery life instructions indicate hours to charge can accept that what can accept is the life of the battery after in the short time have had this keyboard it has died on my twice within day of getting full charge so sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life so now am keeping it wired with the provided cable because cannot be without keyboard when it dies and plugging it into power source is not enough once the battery is dead it will not power up until it has gotten enough of charge to respond but connected to the pc via usb cable makes it online instantly overall poor technical design my only other complaint and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to mechanical desktop keyboard again but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy but while writing this review took moment to look closer the keys on this keyboard are probably good smaller surface area than either laptop typically use this adds to the closeness of the keys and why am constantly off key here and there typing as normally do by feel alone square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable this is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back 
482,be sure your computer be on in order to see the lights on the white mouse Washington so close to returning it as my other mouse with lights was always on careless of my computer but glad problem solved my own problem

1572,iodine have this mouse for days and now it just doesn charge no idea why and ve try everything bash not buy it cheap
8174,bought of these in april both dead purchased two of these for two computers one died about weeks ago to me it seemed the battery wasn holding charge contacted klm for product support sent three emails and heard nothing in return klim product support no matter how fancy their webpage is then grabbed the other one and started using it on my fulltime pc and it died today the fact that one used daily and the other used half as much both died within weeks of each other is very telling two keyboards lasted months if this isn the definition of junk don know what it 
8181,backlight stopped working after first day of use the settings for the backlight bash not work and customer support on their web_site has not responded keyboard works otherwise
8671,not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about months and then fagot no more just wouldn connect to my windows personal_computer at all before that would rich_person given it stars as it had the tax_return button in weird placement compare to standard keyboards and it make look to need charge more frequently than would rich_person liked
15755,iodine absolutely loved my speaker the sound of my music get me pump when make work so definitely recommend it
7184,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the scroller which can be little too hard tend to open many tabs at once at work and while am on pinterest lol but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year 
7599,the battery life on this mouse is terrible it lasts maybe day to day and half without recharging also bit small and the grip is slippery would not recommend it to anyone 
1241,at first it worked perfectly fine then notice the movements on my personal_computer screen become slow and laggy then it finally make waste of time and money
16231,my new speaker was receive day early and plant perfectly couldnt beryllium more happier
9006,good response
8413,it smaller than used to and light the battery look to work well and don bend on and off just goes to sleep it hour_angle the enter barroom in different configuration and be tighter than than use to and that hour_angle been change to get accustomed to like it though
15017,all good 
9267,i have not have to charge the keyborad or the mouse americium on my computer batch and am still running the both of them from the time first intalled the
1883,received first time and it was not working exchanged and the mouse started acting up after few weeks 
5803,dont bargain stopped working after weeks
6228,the design of this mouse is nice rich_person small hands and this mouse be somewhat small and flat however it doesn have very smooth motion used it for about an hour and disconnected it from my laptop
10990,so bought this headphones just to check them out and Lashkar-e-Taiba me Tell this was amazed and very surprised on how the sound quality for this headphones recommend this item percentage
6246,and it only wireless half the time the other one-half you ll rich_person it plug in and charging because charge doesn last very long that why they give you that little short charging wire that plug in the front of the mouse that brand it hard to use when charge everyone knows it easier to drag chain up hill than to push it up well everyone but these people update the battery has completely travel dead it won even take charge anymore after only three months you rich_person to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times and even then it go dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast you have to delay to seconds for it to charge just so you can use it for another seconds it even worse than the star evaluation gave it originally
9664,when turned it on and the back lights look in beautiful rainbow form Washington blow away it is such nice keyboard am definitely impressed with this merchandise upon first receipt what love best about the merchandise be everything really the keys are soft and comfortable with the exception of the space key love how quiet these keys are can type discreetly without being too loud love that the light is adjustable both in form and brightness the breathing manner be very neat feature and like that can adjust the speed of it it has appeasement consequence but also like that can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if Don privation them on the wireless feature is neat because can return it anywhere and position it anywhere and don rich_person to concern about plugging it in like the little legs on the bottom so can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if want it to be more or less ergonomic the battery display is great feature because can Tell when need to plug it in before it loses power also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use on the instructions booklet at the very end it say thinks for reading it should say thanks for reading it obvious that great care Washington take to make high quality merchandise so it disappointing to see such careless mistake one other thing don care for be how loud the space barroom be all the remainder of the keys are soft and hardly make sound but when tap the space barroom it makes loud plastic sound that look to resonate throughout the room for how often it get use was hoping it would be bit quieter other than those two things wouldn change anything this merchandise is very easy to use the instructions be incredibly helpful and well write it nice to see the instructions write out in so many languages it give the impression that this is worldwide company and because of that very successful it gives the company batch of credibility the instructions be easy to read and follow like that the function keys are explain and there be even an illustration of the keyboard with keys label so they are easy to discovery on the real keyboard absolutely love this keyboard and would recommend it to all of my friends whether you rich_person laptop or desktop computer this keyboard is not only great to expression at it plant very well there be an incredible value for the money here have several klim products in my office and love each one americium satisfy with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again

3167,long battery life and get so many compliments on the lights exactly what wanted 
5919,broke already won charge can tax_return stay away from this mouse
6567,i will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it ergonomics feels good in my hand at first but after few minutes you start to realize something is off it little too small for extended use but hey that personal preference for the couple hours did use this thing the sleep mode worked did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up netflix and hulu was nightmare the quiet click is top notch give that outta so ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for little bit they might twitch little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn being used but this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always use split screen and open netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right when move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left it also lags every once in while and sometimes you put the mouse over something leave it there for second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on rows above where was this was on netflix this is nightmare of mouse do not buy its cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option you can buy cheaper mouse that functions properly the led lights did work just fine for me the next morning went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until can get another one 
7635,didn buy this for gambling but it smooth mouse which love work from home and utilize this while on my work and home lap tops
6866,i love this mouse use it on multiple devices and it upload fast like it how sleep manner would kick in if you haven used it in while however it is easy to wake up as well like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors its quite and moves smoothly make mention love it
4901,this mouse last me like calendar_month or two im not able to scroll up exploitation this mouse will not bargain again
142,this merchandise only lasted days idea it Washington not charge but it not that
5365,this is the best mouse superintendent quite and small love it so much the colors are fabulous
2121,so got this in the mail and immediately get_down exploitation it it work great in the beginning super quiet and the color change is cool but after week or two was using it and it just stop working it would bend on but wouldn work on my laptop and it Washington the only computer have use it on can barely get it to move on the screen and then it just shuts off but it really Washington great when first got it
502,this mouse only worked for one charge when charge it the second time everything works backwards privation to go left it goes right your want it to go up it go down don recommend this item they say you can tax_return it
5396,so far great purchase bought rose gold and it looks so cute mouse works well slim and compact 
14640,came with speaker but no directions or charge cable
8175,huge slowdown from keyboard to computer will just stop working randomly you rich_person to knock the keys down to get them to register the key stroke if they even register it at all
6547,this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation 
9155,ordered in may and key stop working at the end of July
2768,mouse never worked with usb arranger flashes once red and never connects clearly cheap construction and plastic not even sure it charge properly glows blue briefly and then bend back off
2048,this is the second time ve replace this mouse and after being fully charge the power doesn come on will never buy again the merchandise support is nonexistent
10209, by far my favorite headset 
10698,these worked amazing for gambling supper happy noise cancel be perfect and love the color and comfortable worth the money for some cheaper headphones
203,iodine purchased this mouse thinking it have usb connection not usb with usb adapter my bad choose to keep it three stars on its scroll as it was not smooth but it worked would rich_person keep it but after couple of weeks it die and would not charge despite being plug in for hours don waste your money go with tried and true trade_name
15411,this speaker sounds better than my environment sound it hour_angle very long battery life use mine few times week and it sound great no matter how loud rich_person it my iphone connects faster to the bluetooth in this speaker than in my car and have car so it pretty up to date say would buy another one but one be plenty for my needs also it such good quality that Don think ll need to buy another one anytime soon however will recommend this speaker to everyone
4294,so cute and very easy to use really recommend it battery last long
15478,have be eyeball this one for years love the pink color expression exactly as it does in the picture
13775,my son likes the headphones he state they are really comfortable and plant with his laptop and game
12658,pros games sound nice and loud without any distortion cheap but good great first time gaming head set comfortable even when playing for four or more hours cons no noise canceling large and somewhat cumbersome cord is long and thick so if you have it plugged into ps or ps controller it is annoyingly in the way usb connector for the led lights is also annoying not even sure what the lights are for anyway you can see them when wearing the headset unless you play in front of mirrior good cheap entry level headset my first one it is comfortable and lightweight but feels reasonably sturdy sound is nice an loud crisp but not lot of bass would definitely recommend for the casual gamer like myself microphone is omnidirectional and pretty sensitive so keep that in mind if you are playing in noisy environment

5391,it work good but not great
10506,this merchandise has very low quality sound it sound weak the microphone hour_angle to beryllium turned up and is very low quality it sounds like cb radio
11588,the microphones too quiet
3075,easy to set up and use like the slim design
6251,purchased months ago and nothing to do but throw it away charging port is loose and won connect with cable flimsy and not made to last like nearly everything today the colored lights might be fun but better to pay for quality that doesn need replaced 
10753,loved the headset incredible sound
12442,too tight
5079,works as expected like the colors they puts little sunshine in my work day sleep mode is too quick for me but it wakes up quickly after good shake

6108,easy to use charge lasts long time
5492,iodine charged the mouse for over hours and never even charge it doesn even work bend it on and it blinks red have already started tax_return waste of time and money
15781,very skeptical at the beginning did lots of research on competitors Lashkar-e-Taiba beryllium honest this be not going to replace total sound system if that what you are dream of but this speaker go from room to room and outside and give sound that be of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are miss out on something better bought this for family member first saw how good it Washington then bought one for myself within the same week battery life is great would definitely recommend this

11093,iodine actually have to walk up to my grandson before he hear me these are great
3882,i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feel nice in my hand the only downside be that the right chink has tendency to stick even when americium only exploitation the left chink ve have it for few days now and that the only negative
13149,these work well and the sound quality is good they completely screen the ears and look to beryllium comfortable enough they rest on the pad on top of the head and would probably get tired of that with extended wear but overall they are good merchandise at good monetary_value
10796,for gambling and even for non gaming gripe rich_person about this headset be the volume and mic accountant it like you rich_person remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair the usb cable be also an annoyance addition it cool for people who privation glowing headsets but for people who Don need to waste the energy for the lights it an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop so the design could definitely beryllium better as for the noise cancellation not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have test the mic and even with the mic all the manner up you have to manually mute yourself exploitation the volume accountant otherwise people can still hear you but you will seem like you rhenium far away from the computer the sound quality be okay play games and watched movies with these while watching shows movies with just the aux millimeter jack did notice some voice echoing this isn super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this the headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it look pretty small so for those with larger ears these might beryllium more of on ear headphones rather than over ear ones the shock_absorber Department_of_Energy eventually injury to support the headset on for an extended time_period of time but hope after erosion the shock_absorber down bit the comfortability will increase overall the headset be okay since get it on sale it decent set of headphones
16783,i really love the bass it gives out for good sized speaker was expecting little more boom but overall it great sounding speaker that hits pretty decent high sound level 
1038,great mouse nothing super illusion comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there be an option to not rich_person them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plug in if necessary plug in to different computers and work immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent monetary_value will update if anything changes
13436,great sound for price no noise canceling at all besides foam around ears also need extra usb plug for lights feel it unnecessary 
7287,mouse works lgb die almost immediately the only color actively working on this mouse be the red led and the blue when charging when the mouse is left idle for minute or two it look to desync and return minute to wake up it get in the manner more often than not otherwise okay merchandise

5424,iodine made the mistake of reading the reviews only after buy the mouse because it have stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine proverb few reviews that said the seller try to bribe them into remove their reappraisal that make me really regret buying from such an unethical business Don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mouse out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it manner too thin and lightweight when exploitation it it very easy to knock it out of topographic_point and chink something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put_option it ve never had this issue with mouse before the trailing detector be also manner too sensitive the cursor still move when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking motion when you lift it up the cord to charge it be pretty short although that not huge issue just kind of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes spot of manhandle it felt like Washington departure to interruption some of the cheap thin plastic when first plug it in as for expression the edges where the paint or whatever it be on the top are pretty rough and it even come with some of the paint chip off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it dark and much heater toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you privation but it still emit red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power

408,i purchased for my kids to use while doing online class work it was easy to set up and seems to work well was hoping for something that felt more sturdy it feels very cheap the kids love the changing lights while they use the mouse my only complaint is that if they don remember to turn off the noise after use then it dies and has to be recharged before if can be used again
4618,debris
6715,it beautiful and sleek
7249,iodine bought this mouse recently for new laptop buy and it be perfect the mouse be an extremely portable radio mouse it actually feel very comfortable while using it theres no side buttons or extras on it just simple portable mouse that cna connect via usb or with the included usb to usb adapter recommend this mouse because of the monetary_value and what you get for it
16433,great portable bluetooth speaker soap volume could be better but certainly recommend the purchase
15303,lasts for few hours at close to max volume and obviously longer the lower the volume be great over all for the monetary_value but the back hour_angle an annoyance clicking sound like the screws to panel are lose
2680,iodine bought this mouse for home use use it about two hours per day for two weeks then no connection idea it necessitate to be charged plugged it in and let to sit for two hours as teach now there be nothing tried to charge longer but nothing be working do not buy this polonium
15483,perfective for filling space with sound and blocking out ambient noise
14253,overall this is great speaker it clear loud and pretty user friendly the battery look to beryllium pretty good at volume or less but close to the top of the volume scope it really lack in battery life when have it at charge and volume it will barely last me getting ready in the morning probably takes me minutes

10870,nice and compact
4206,not fan wouldn sync with one computer work great with the other computer but it didn sleep when Washington done with it so the next day the battery was dead ll never remember to bend off the mouse when not exploitation it so this be not departure to be very useful
4122,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer
6283,battery life is horrible on this mouse South_Korean_won last more than minutes idea it Washington fluke and got replacement because the mouse is comfortable and cool looking but the second one they sent me Washington even worse with whack minute battery life after full charge
1879,i grabbed this because was having difficulty with my mouse pad on my laptop but it great love how compact it is and it hasn had any issues since bought it like years ago 
8465,comfortable keyboard very good must have 
1013,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked Don feel as though this will beryllium adequate for long term gambling but it ll beryllium alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the monetary_value couldn ask for much more but bash think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it be also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reappraisal you rich_person to connect the receiver to the arranger it takes good spot of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve be more clear about that but it whatever
13091,iodine used this headset with my xbox one get it for on black Friday deal which Washington nice though guess get what paid for was lured in little by the light-emitting_diode lights and Washington bit disappointed to discovery out wouldn beryllium able to use them since they only trip when connect to pc the sound quality was as expect for headset wasn amazing but was by no means awful the ear cuffs are definitely noise blocking and they re surprisingly comfortable to wear even if you wear glasses since wear glasses most headsets start to injury my ears after while but experience no pain with this one the mic Washington okay never really had any problems with it did have slight problems with the volume control though sometimes it would catch hang-up on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down wasn that big of an issue though since it rarely happen say my only valid ailment was the disappointment of only having it for months before it died was really excited about this headset the whole reason buy it Washington so could get something that would last me bit longer than cheap headset would but it barely last me four months what even worse be that still currently rich_person headset that has last longer and person who return care of all things electronic and electronic associate so this Washington the consequence of the actual headset failing might have given it or stars had it be of use for just little while longer
12133,it is great merchandise for what pay for it be more durable than idea and give the extra boost was looking for
13970,superintendent comfortable on ears great for long time use
5587,straight out of the box the left click button doesn work completely useless sending back don waste your time like rich_person
16679,these are very easy to set up and sound incredible easy to link several together also
7,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider 
8276,iodine like the keyboard for all of its features except for one the enter key it difficult to touch type due to the weird shape of the key support hit the backslash key when really privation to hit the enter key normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key this South_Korean_won beryllium problem for those who Don touch type but for those of us who bash it an impossible range when trying to fly at words per minute for this reason Don recommend this particular keyboard going to be look for new keyboard
15351,excellent sound good build quality supports aux in annoying feature turns sound off if volume low but acceptable workaround turn up volume on device app is only to connect multiple speakers no other features for me not an issue 
3468,iodine was look to bargain portable mouse for travel and Washington going to buy regular battery one but saw this dad up as an option really like the batch green color it affordable easy to use connects fast and very low profile the clicker be quiet too scroller plant great as well charge it up connected via usb to my dock station and it was ready to go love it
15112,sound is awesome plus water proof be bonus
10464,for the monetary_value can complain good novice headset for crippled

5377,my other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries so had to get another one love that it is rechargable and has the lights the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side thats cool also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny didnt know before buying but it has sleep mode so thats great for if forget to turn it off have to double check the manual but there are switches and dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into usb port to connect to your device honestly like it only other thing is im not sure how know when its dying again may be in the manual 
539,the mouse broke couple days after the return window reached out and heard nothing back not fun throwing money away like that 
3031,don get me wrong do like this mouse it smooth pretty easy to use and overall pretty great but and this is strong but if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it or my dog or even me it could be super light and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over it really annoying

3142,i do not recommend this mouse work all of days change the batteries and it still does not work spend your money on basic mouse that plant
14618,purchased in July and it work until february when it fail to pair with my macbook pro repeated attempts to resolve issue using all available tech support include jbl tech support failures all note that this item hour_angle year guarantee after much time energy use jbl harman sent me new refurbished charge mid may same narrative it fail to pair after repeated attempts requested refund deny if you buy this item from amazon or any other rd seller you will not get refund if you must rich_person this speaker buy direct from jbl harmon but please dont bother if you are amac owner run away quickly from this flop
14681,the speaker is faulty it won turn off if press the power button it just turns right back on some of the buttons don work properly either pressing the volume down button shuts the power off and still it turns back on automatically it annoyingto hear the startup sound and shut down sounds all day and night as it turns itself on and off automatically 
3558,the cord going into for charging doesn fit exactly right seems cheaply made wouldn buy this brand again

8145,iodine got this keyboard because my computer be not under direct light and at night it difficult or impossible to see what you rhenium typing can use this in the dark and it only stays literature when in use so it not radiance all day hanker the rainbow colors are pretty only wish it had volume button you can push fn function but would rich_person liked just and up down mute feature somewhere
13124,nice color big and comfortable but doesn feel heavy only disfavor is that the led lights Don work unless you use the usb

16166,whereas on the charge the bass gets bit overwhelming on the charge the bass feels not existant by comparison further sound on the charge be less clear than on the charge details in your music get off faint notes disappear although the bass on the charge could be overwhelming the overall sound quality Washington much better further the charge be heavier bulkier than the charge despite less functionality on the charge could brand telephone calls but there be no calling ability on the charge if the charge upgrade its bluetooth to beryllium better compatible with more modern devices would trash the charge and go back to the charge the only improvement on the charge over the charge be that the power button is bit easier to press
3239,the mouse worked great love it actually but the charge cord be sever and while it does charge it also will shock you little if you accidentally touch it while plug into charge port or plug the mouse in and because the charge cord is only inches hard to refrain from touch where it is severed will stop using this when new different mouse arrives
7908,great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again

8202,the keyboard lights up beautifully it just never works with the computer complete waste of money 
9653,works great adjustable lighting stays charged for long time no chord in the way smooth keys light weight only small complaints when it is in sleep mode whatever key you hit to wake it actually works therefore you have possibly typed wrong key when using password to open something also you can pick one solid color again nothing major would buy another one or recommend it

1951,has work well for over year now buy light still freshness no issues with the function Don game or anything so it had light use it has surprising sum of battery
17332,iodine bought this because desire to get good bluetooth speaker and debate between this and the ue boom because they are about the same monetary_value after doing little research figured that the jbl would sound better and surprise the jbl sound really good good bass at low volumes great mids and highs for portable speaker it Department_of_Energy distort slightly when you get bass heavy song exploitation spotify built in equivalent with bass boost but nothing little equivalent can solve it bend the bass down when you are close to max volume to protect itself which is nice and it still sounds decent at soap volume scope be awesome can walk about feet away before it starts film_editing out hopefully it stopping_point will update reappraisal if it breaks from normal use or anything like that but so far so good
14872,amazing quality the best bluetooth speaker
8165,it brought it month ago and it has already stopped working 
1167,it broke from one say to the next sad cause it Washington cute and very handy but the merchandise just didn last long at all

17181,good price works well can survive long drops
7386,iodine was look for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the coil wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the chink be very quiet yet there be satisfy tactile feel to it though the right chink can beryllium bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse be that it be rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be use while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led index that bend off to show when the mouse is make charge the mouse will also go into sleep manner after minutes of inaction to save power overall great mouse
831,i do presentations for work and can plug my lap top into the television and use the mouse to progress slides
14359,boating
15794,really good sound and also charge your telephone
12069,it pretty good
5267,this mouse stops working even when fully charge and the light on the bottom be on this did not start happening until weeks after the tax_return window end would not recommend buying this for these reasons it Washington waste of money
6113,didn work from the minute opened it Don waste your money
9231,stopped working less than month after purchase 
3382,even with sleep manner the battery doesn last full work day
966,the first few weeks it worked great then all of sudden the coil stop working and it just spins rich_person to physically grab the side of the page to move down really disappointed
3912,works very well keep the led light close off to save battery ve have it for about week and haven needed to charge it yet shut it off when not in use it so nice not to rich_person cord to deal with privation to bargain another one love it so much the color be gorgeous
15067,my speaker won turn on it dead and useless such disappointment 
6873,i bought this mouse thinking rechargeable was the way to do it worked well for about day tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all ve gone back to battery operated mouse 
9941,constant thump would personally burn or knock
8283,this is my third klim keyboard love the first they change something on the design because the space barroom be terrible now doesn work if off center at all
8481,at first glance the keyboard looks and feels nice the keys are decently silent though very loud compare to my other low profile minimalistic keyboard and the rgb be cool however there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use the function key be on the right side of the spacebar which be non standard so very weird to use keyboard shortcuts like ctrl shift for dev tools in chrome am programmer only plant on the right side of the keyboard not the left which use to and works on every other keyboard ve ever used and the issue can not be repair with the klim reset keyboard jazz_band so you re stuck with the issue the rgb be somewhat faint and even on the static setting doesn stay on it dims after not very long at all of inaction making me rich_person to constantly type to keep it onoverall would save your money you could get much better keyboard for the same monetary_value that doesn rich_person the glitches or annoyances honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that klim continues to sell known defective merchandise without offering returns what fake
4488,put one star because this shop sent me bad mouse twice the first Washington working then not working the next did not work at all just waste time and money
725,stops working even when it fully charge
12295,cheap monetary_value cheap merchandise
12880,great sound quality for the money cancels background noise perfectly really comfortable to wear merchandise will bargain again
15567,works well but there is no manner to adjust treble or base sound quality International_Relations_and_Security_Network what we expect it to be used it days with assortment of music and returned it
16040,my trade_name new jbl doesn charge even once hard reset didn work getting new charge cable didn work either have it replace for another one and faced the same problem again not worth replacing again especially given the undependability of the battery ll probably get bose or beats
1390,it works excellent it be very awesome
12741,never worked
8594,the back light is great it still spot stiff compare to my old one but acquiring used to it highly recommend it lots of knock for the vaulting_horse
2497,dissatisfied darn thing stopped working
11305,sounds quality was fine but stop working within months keep the cord heterosexual and didn bend it much but it losing connection
14608,very portable good battery life great sound quality
6141,this mouse is prettt okay it plant fine and light up pretty which be bonus not fan of the feeling of clicking though wish bought different mouse for that reason but will hold onto it for now
2147,okay understand that having mouse with cool shift lights Washington probably departure to result in somewhat reduced battery life just didn expect this the mouse look to rich_person no sleep manner the lights stay on unless it completely switch_over off and the battery lasts less than two days trade_name new idea to myself that could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night because do like how the mouse feels and works except last night plug it in and this morning hours later it wasn done charge rich_person resorted to just keeping it plug in all day while exploitation it which kind of defeats the purpose of having radio mouse in the first topographic_point and ties up two usb ports instead of just one shame back to the drawing board on my mouse search
16008,not great battery life and not for loud listening 
9289,fantastic keyboard for its monetary_value
15104,it is on the heavier side but overall no issues hour_angle an unexpectedly long charge cord
2718,i didn know it Washington possible to like mouse so much it be very comfortable and smooth the battery life is pretty long Don like having to charge it because sometimes forget to plug it in and then it go dead the battery life usually last around week as long as can remember to charge it it be fantastic
