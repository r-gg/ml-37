6024,nice looking mouse beautiful colors and comfortable hold for any sized hands the battery on this thing is surprising charging does take time but seriously that won be problem because this thing can last long do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn drain sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won get caught off guard for when it does lose battery ,69,5.0

7267,i like this mouse but the battery literally died in day charging it now see how long that takes say ,20,5.0
15285,this speaker is awesome was bit skeptical about the passive radiators but was impressed it doesn pump bass as much as wired speaker such as echo plus but the sound is still excellent and the battery life is great usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week gave it stars due to the poor usb implementation the speaker charges through its usb port however it is only able to output power to act like powerbank and charge phone for example through its usb port my recommendation to jbl is to ditch the usb port entirely and use the usb port for charging and power output ,112,5.0
8234,good lighting on the keys for typing in low lighting comfortable typing perfect keyboard size not huge but not tiny either wish there was way to but batteries in it in case the internal rechargeable battery ever goes out it does come with cable for charging overall very good keyboard happy with it so far ,55,5.0
15972,the mid and high range is bit lower than expected however the bass levels help compensate to deliver good sound this is fantastic for the back patio and beach battery life span ha snot been fully tested but in uses has thus far drained my cell phone faster than the speaker the port in back can help charge as well,60,5.0
10432,the wires are flimsy around the audio jack and mic jack to the point that you have to adjust them specific way to get sound to come out of both sides of the headset accidently move the wire and you have to try to readjust it ,46,4.0

5534,okay so cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse my husband is the gamer can however let you know about my general usage opinion first off it pretty love the color and love that it lights up on the sides there is setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain ve been using it for days pretty consistently and haven needed to charge it there wasn any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used just plugged in the small usb and it immediately worked that all can say at this point since haven had it that long will update this review in few months and include any issues may experience and any new opinions develop ,134,5.0

3158,i mean this is wireless mouse that has pretty lights and stuff but swear it doesn catch well and have to slide it like pro curler either it dies really fast or it just decides to stop properly working not sure what the true issue is like the texture and how sleek it is but when it doesn properly work it drives me absolutely nuts even got mouse pad and it still gives me issues ,75,5.0

9832,update one of the keyboards was dropped once and the spacebar ceased to function that was total loss the other one bought lasted years and worked great during that time then the spacebar also stopped working was not dropped paid for it and it now so opted for different model this time and like it very much it asin bmqhh if you want to search it previous review not sure if this is really gaming keyboard but needed something that lights up when all my lights are out this does the job do wish it ran on batteries but hopefully the charging connector won poop out on me one charge lasted quite while my favorite part of this keyboard is the light noise the keys make the spacebar is bit noisier but the rest of the buttons have pleasant tapping sound without being very clacky like some gaming keyboards waited about months for prices to go down and ordered to of these by accident when found the deal keeping both ,170,5.0

15397,amazing sound ,2,5.0
10298,they were decently sounding with good amount of noise cancellation however these were more intended for pc because there is two cords one for sound and one for the lights the cord is too short to connect it to the ps also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming ,55,5.0
8908,i only bought this for the silent keys have newborn baby and needed silent clicks but this keyboard was more loud than my current gaming keyboard if you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere didn even connect it simply started typing and was disappointed stars being generousmaybe the company is comparing their keys to mechanical stroke keyboard if that were the case then every keyboard would be silent compared to those ,73,5.0

8042,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it ,111,5.0
16659,i really wasnt expecting this to sound and be as good as it is can literally hear the speaker from outside my house while the bass is the main star of the show it leaves me little disappointed that the treble and other minor but important rythms get drowned out lot of the time it could also be the music play so cant fault it too much overall really glad got what paid for and bit more as well,79,5.0
12488,overall comfortable headset with sensitive omni directional mic bit too sensitive at times great price point and aesthetic ,18,4.0

3953,it good mouse ,3,5.0
1642,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product ,150,1.0
7682,i had to get another mouse this wouldn respond to clicks or scrolling about of the time even when got the mousepad that improves mouse functioning ,26,1.0
1812,the first mouse lasted months and bought the same mouse to replace it it died within day of using it buy cheap get cheap not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for refund the first one worked great and had satisfying button click shame it didn last very long ,54,4.0

14951,i love the speaker it great the sound is great upset didn order it sooner ,15,5.0
5003,i enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up but that is essentially it the battery storage on the mouse is super low so you ll have to plug it in any way after about half hour of use maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow led light feature the mouse scroll wheel broke on me in middle of game not any aggressive game mind you just house decorating sim and ve hardly used it for the six or so months ve had it to sum up for quick cheap purchase it looks great but isn worth it in the long run and regret not buying different mouse ,111,5.0

16400,thing sounds great until it shorts literally had the thing month and it shorted out and will not work contacted jbl harmon and was essentially scoffed at since then ve replaced both the battery and motherboard to no avail cannot remember the last time wasted nearly like this ,48,5.0
17211,i purchased the jbl charge because of reviews had also purchased ue megaboom not the newer megaboom the two were equally priced so it came down to sound and features the jbl allows for charging device and for using plug in direct jack instead of bluetooth thought those were more important when ordered it until listened to them side by side had listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs the other listeners liked the megaboom better but couldn identify why found the megaboom to have tighter bass and much better transparent mids and highs the charge sounded muddy in lows mids highs in comparison alone it can sound okay as long as you don have competitive reference sound quality beat out battery charging and the aux input ,131,5.0
15015,my niece brought this unit to my house for camp out and was so impressed with it that bought one the next day ,23,5.0

4197,second one same issue the mouse wheel just stops working do not order this product learn from my mistakes ,19,1.0
9627,it an ok product for the most part there are few things that noticed that lead me to give this product only stars the sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable it turns off the led lights after about seconds and if you re trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard there should be an ability to leave it on the brightness on the led lights is not very good in completely dark room it may be passable but in room with partial illumination like lamp or even the light from your tv monitor screen the keys get little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen the chroma colors make such dimly lit product that much harder to see and you can adjust this it would be better if you could make it just green white or blue lights but the chroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim to top it off the leds are so far under the keys that you get more of halo effect around the underside of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves the only pros have about this product are the price cheap for what it is the quiet no click of the keys perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep usb charger compatible aside from the things mentioned at the top of this post there are some extras that could have made this product better dedicated buttons for ff rev play pause vol up down mute having to constantly press function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charger is plugged in had mouse that did this and it was great feature and when the battery could no longer hold charge just replaced it the ghz dongle is awesome but also having bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don have usb ports but keep the dongle not happy with mine will return it and spend little more on better solution for me ,382,5.0

6593,i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have ,76,1.0

15233,an attractive high performing speaker that exceeded my expectations first the bad news did have difficulty at first pairing my phone with the speaker the included instructions were no help and would have liked to see bit more detail it just series of what look like comic book panels begrudgingly downloaded the jbl portable app found bit more information and was able to pair straight out of the box the sound is bit disappointing the speaker did not produce much bass and was really heavy in the upper midrange and high frequencies would highly recommend downloading an equalizer app on your music source device now the good news the equalizer made this speaker come alive volume for days and more bass that would have expected for speaker this size the fact that it can also charge your music source device is even more reason to select this speaker ,148,5.0

9063,ill start with cons unresponsive sometimes doesnt tell if the battery is low there is no indicator so if youre playing intensely and stops all of sudden it will pissed off little keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical it will make sound depends how heavy you type you can customize the rgb its fixed pros keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off keyboard lights has modes which is cool steady pulse and no lights you can also adjust the light from low to high rechargable and has its own usb type cable and has its own bluetooth connector to pc when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to to days without charging it goes on sleep mode if not in use lightweight always put this on my lap since my pc is connected to my tv and always play from my bed budget friendly its good keyboard if youre not ready for razer and corsair type of peripherals and looking for budget friendly one then give this keyboard try update am returning the keyboard as it is faulty the and quotation mark got switched its becoming more and more unresponsive got this days ago and its not doing so well update on battery it lasts days max if used casually am changing my review to star and dont recommend this now better look for something else or really invest to good brand gaming keyboard instead its waste of time and money for just little feature ,262,5.0
3723,nice and soft but the laser isn very accurate,9,5.0
10763,i love this and it works great you can adjust the sound and mute your mic very easily the only down side is that you need usb port to make it light up it really does not matter if it lighted up or not but play on ps and only have remote don have pc to plug the usb into to make it light up but overall love it ,69,3.0

7860,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to ,328,5.0

10175,these headphones are comfortable and the noise cancelling is great the sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mic the only issue is the wires it impossible to use the lights through the usb and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my laptop because the usb and headphones inserts are on opposite sides and the wire isn long enough which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that too short the extender they give with the product also seems cheap the sound through the headphones with the extender is completely messed up to the point of it being unusable none of these problems are with the headphones itself so still gave stars but it annoying that can use every feature included honestly the product is solid stars ,147,1.0

9461,i purchased this keyboard for use with my gaming machine using it upon my lap in chair with arm rests it doesn fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it wish the keys were more centrally located for my back sake great backlight which dealuminates after use keys are bit clunky an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine which use hours every day ,105,5.0
9406,my office desk has slide out tray for the keyboard and this keyboard is perfect for that because of its slim design there is no wasted space had to replace more expensive keyboard for that reason and actually like this one much better the only complaint have is that the caps lock key is apparently where my fingers and brain feel like the shift key should be hopefully will adjust to that ,72,5.0

15113,if you are buying this most probably you have done your research and for me it lives up to its expectation the speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill large room if you want to use it outdoors it will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you re having party it gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around is when there is sound distortion great for movie night in bed and for listening to music having owned the flip twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging but wish it had strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and wish it had microphone sometimes but also understand why they didn include it on here ,131,5.0
5712,the mouse is aesthetically very cute and does feel nice on the hand main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities the mouse will randomly jump across the screen which has never happened with any other mouse it led to misclicks ve deleted emails didn mean to because of it essentially just unreliable ,55,5.0

14703,i like that now when you answer the phone it automatically takes your call off speaker to allow for private conversation on the older models it would blast right through the speakers and you have to scramble for head phones or run to turn off the jbl speaker thank god don have to do that anymore however do wish that it was optional for only the music to continue softly in the background separate from phone conversations wouldn mind having few more of these around the house since think they link together love the speakers great sound very convenient for wherever and whenever ,103,5.0

7376,the color wasn like the photo it bit darker than what was expecting see photo for reference did love that the mouse came with usb to usb adapter the part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was stuck so had to use excessive force to remove it only other thing could change is the led colors it goes through series of colors but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be ,79,5.0

11,first one broke in week they sent replacement and returned broken one and it still hasn processed return now new one broke weeks later would not recommend this mouse,29,2.0
9129,i ll first mention that if you are buying this you probably don want to spend an arm and leg for gaming keyboard however you definitely get the most for what you pay for ve been using this keyboard for months now and though it isn as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done don really care too much about the light features fading mode breathing mode but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light if the room is well lit you can definitely tell rgb is lit but its bit dimmer than expected at night was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key you can see the color very clearly between the keys but not so much for through each key the only improvement suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of typing and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard besides that the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in which is pretty convenient like said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine klim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues ,237,1.0
14926, alright first of all the reason here writing this is lost one of these off the bed of my truck at about mph on an asphalt road it dropped rolled and bounced into the ditch and found it few hours later see video now first thing thought was this thing toast nope not this speaker dang thing fires right up and goes right back to playing solid sounds love these speakers have since day one here after year of pretty consistent use to say still love these speakers battery life is great for the sound they put out the connectivity option to listen with multiple at one time is the reason bought them and love that would buy again jbl or bust in my book ,125,5.0
5136,i was so excited to receive this mouse chose it because the color with so nice bought it in mint green and the features of the multicolor led lights however to my surprise this mouse doesn hold charge after maybe two hours of use it done and needs to be charged for few hours in order to be used again naturally went back to my original apple mouse ,68,1.0

9507,i have been using this keyboard for about or days now and so far it works really well for it intended purpose love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when am typing that being said there are few things that knocked this keyboard down to only stars the first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent this is not the case in fact have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the enter key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys for me this hasn been huge deal but can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having quiet keyboard the second thing is that the led lights are not as bright as would have wanted in the dark they stand out perfectly and look amazing however in daytime or brighter lighting the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard ,174,4.0
3687,i find this mouse easy to use fits my hand very well wear medium sized glove and moves fairly smoothly say fairly smooth because used mouse pad with smooth soft surface it seemed to drag just little when tried smooth hard surface it worked better you do have to click button to wake up the mouse when it goes to sleep mode my other one woke up with just moving it thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but dont even notice it would probably buy again ,92,5.0

14775,sounds awesome easy to connect ,5,4.0
11945,the reason why bought this was because wanted better sound quality when played video games the reason why it is good is because it has good sound quality for example you can hear lot of things with the headphones like where things are say you can hear someone you know if they are on the right or the left the next reason is that it has long cord so it doesn make you lean forward when you play game for example when you use normal headphones the cord is so short that when you plug it in you have to lean forward to make sure that you can use it these headphones you have no problem the last reason is that it has the ability to connect to all devices for example you can connect it to things like pc ps xbox ect after using them think that would recommend them ,151,4.0
11561,a bit heavy and awkward but would expect that at this price point my only real complaint is in the cord design am using with ps and the cord splits in one is mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound which works fine the other is usb jack that supplies power to the led lights and should plug into the console the problem is that the cord splits at the last inches or so if you want to use the usb for the lights you need to either buy separate usb extension or keep your controller at least inches from your console which is very impractical if not impossible just bad design it should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time had stars but lowered to because don like companies that offer money for reviews they ve been sending incessant emails saying they will refund if remove my review how about you just make decent product my integrity can be bought for ,179,5.0

2613,it does everything ordered it to do for good price rechargeability is huge plus to me for wireless mouse the clicks are satisfying and it feels nice to hold my only gripe is that the lights on it are bit weak but honestly don care about that in the slightest and that not why bought it so it not big deal ,61,5.0
14240,i was debating between the jbl charge and different version of the jbl and so glad went with this one the sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely jbl speakers on amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop the quality is amazing and it so load for how small it is this one doesn come with case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality haven had any issues or scratches and ve just been throwing it in tote bag the charging port for your phone is so nice too and chargers relatively fast if you re debating between this one and pricier one would go with the charge ,128,5.0

7234,i have had this mouse for all of minutes and am planning on returning it honestly it looks nice and like that it rechargable however it easily one of the worst ve ever used ve used probably different models in my career alone first clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse ve used and on top of that it very inconsistent looking through the gaps where the leds show out of can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is tiny plastic arm no chance that will lasts for an expected period of time it seemed to have been packaged fine so don believe it was damaged or doa don buy this ,117,5.0
16069,i have flip and this charge ive played both and im little disappointed with the charge my flip has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge its weird the flip sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume where the charge doesn sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip the only thing consider the charge to have over the flip is it doesn get too distorted at max volume like the flip but the flip just sounds great almost at any level but at max maybe little less bass on the flip too but not by much im beginning to regret my charge purchase wish just went with new flip and see how that works out btw used the charge for hotel room bluetooth soundbar since live in hotels while working each month so good sound means lot to me especially when get noise complaints from the host ,175,5.0

9044,this keyboard looks and feels really nice it nice and quiet and like the rainbow color display don game much so can really opine on its quality there but imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do although that big enter button might throw you off little bit if you re not used to the layout kept hitting the insert key instead of the backspace from time to time have screen display two are daisy chained monitors using displayport and one is tv using hdmi noticed that in its regular position on my desk it seemed to type fine on screen have somewhat delayed buggy input on screen and perhaps due to the distance between the dongle and the tv no response on there moved the dongle to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side but it still didn accept any input from my keyboard when wasn even feet away from my computer to me that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is large drawback for wireless keyboard especially when paid for it had cheaper logitech that worked just fine for about feet and only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued want to like this because it works great when it wants to but the problems ve had just in the first week aren worth what paid for it almost never return anything but think gonna have to with this ,260,5.0

3680,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries ,143,4.0

14970,i bought this about months ago and it worked perfect in the course of normal use turned it off and then went to plug it in immediately after noticed the unit wouldnt charge and proceeded to try several other chargers to no avail since product is slightly more than year old jbl is offering to give me the names of local repair shops that can pay out of pocket to fix this shoddy workmanship for premium product that is more than likely designed to break after warranty so you ll have to buy another just dont get how it can work and after turning if off while working it would proceed to never turn on again if you want to throw away every year then this is the perfect speaker for you was offered discount on future speaker but that is not the answer wanted or expected ,147,5.0

16853,i bought this because wanted portable speaker with an old fashioned aux input unfortunately the aux input has horrible flaw if couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you re listening too the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again you ll lose about half second of audio as it turns on again too like let say you re listening to an album couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you ll lose the first little bit of the folllowing song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens so so annoying after little internet sleuthing found out that this is just how they are apparently you can fix it by shorting chip on the motherboard but not doing that returning it rip jbl really dumb ,152,5.0

14266,it an adequate speaker for this price point ll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine do not feel like wasted money but if when buy another of these types of speakers it won be jbl it been at least years since ve bought one of these bt speakers and my last speaker was just as loud clear cost less had features that just worked and even came with lanyard for easy carry this thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands volume and sound quality it loud in room with no ambient noise my music is mostly rock like metallica pantera white zombie like loud music and for my private office it perfect ll mostly listen at volume so can think but it nice to jam out sometimes at middle volume level the sound is the best lows vs highs above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise you could use this in an environment with ambient noise like warehouse or kitchen but you would need to stay around if you want to really enjoy what is playing after it probably going to sound more like noise than music phone connectivity is simple for music just push top button but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker had in the price point there are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this the manual certainly is no help but it not what needed it for just liked it as nice side feature used sometimes with my last speaker like this battery life is fine haven done complete testing on this it does have pretty significant battery in it for the charge your device option but hrs maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music won need it for longer than hrs most of the time so doubt this will come up as an issue for me there an app but it does very little for this speaker most useful feature is digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker thankfully for it main function of bt connecting and playing music it pretty basic and simple if you go the route of multiple speakers reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work it is not intuitive it series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews ,425,5.0

10596,bought these after my kids broke my sony gold headset while these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being wireless expected step down in quality as was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kids and cats could learn to mind others things while they are step down surprised at how much like them like the volume control on the cord rather than the headset so can see if it if need to and while not as great they do have some noise cancellation there isn much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point think that would be asking for too much overall happy with them and until feel the need to get more expensive pair these will be what use will definitely hold onto them as backup pair if ever do upgrade as well ,159,1.0

2313,first off love the color it what made me purchase it in the first place didn need mouse but like having spare now for my review as far as what used to for comfort this mouse sits flat so be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time fits nicely in your hand have medium small hands so please take that into consideration with the review the lights loved the different light modes it actually made it feel like had gaming mouse while not being so hard on my wallet now for push button response my right click wasn working properly barely clicked down and would sometimes mia click from it being mispositioned had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad broke it off and now it is clicking as intended so please be aware this is all very fragile plastic within its housing overall the mouse is great if you need spare and would buy again if needed another hate out of stars because feels worse than but feel an is more accurate to how feel as it has lot of great features such as charging vs batteries and an included usb adapter overall wonderful product that do recommend,212,5.0

8657,this klim would likely be an incredible gamer keyboard which is what it made for it sturdy has cool multi colored backlight so as long as you re young and or can type without looking at the keys you ll probably love it wanted backlit bluetooth keyboard for my laptop but the klim multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent and so were difficult to read the top characters of some keys didn light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key and found the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added variability to the characters that impacted their legibility for me ended up keeping seenda much thinner and flatter adjustable backlighting in choice of several colors but only one at time so the keys were consistently bright sharp and clear ,137,5.0

12986,i wasn expecting much heading into my time with bengoo gaming headset after all it costs around and is made by relatively unproven brand surely it can beat the likes of astro steelseries turtle beach and the like right nope it can but what you do get is surprisingly solid pair of cans for your gaming needs the bengoo is an over ear headset featuring inline volume control flip boom microphone and non customizable blue led lights it looks the part it plays for those who like something bit flashy looking though personally was never fan of the sharp pointy edges that mainstream gaming accessories tend to sport ,108,5.0
16990, this speaker sounds great thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass mids highs are clear could be little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is full rich sound and using an eq brings out more of its capabilities jbl quality construction was on the fence about buying this because they went to mono driver but you can really tell difference in fidelity you can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the charge completely happy with it and love the green color one thing do not like is they took away the speaker phone put the speakerphone back that thing like and is missing on this as for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the charge update liked it so much got another one camo these sound great it actually has bass no issues with connectivity or battery this is the best speaker in this class or category there are some that come close but these can be beat the price hike is downer don know what going on there that crazy got these for and that what they should be seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price not cool at they aren that great would expect more at that price ,229,4.0

8125,i purchased this keyboard last year in november and have been very satisfied with it performance it is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool but it would be better if the sleep mode didn take effect so soon this is an issue when in dim room because it can be bit difficult to see the opaque lettering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights additionally recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with and last week it began shutting off intermittently even while connected that should have alerted me to the fact that it was cable issue and not battery issue but it didn and contacted klim customer service lolita the customer service agent responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try different cable but she also reiterated that there was year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue charging with different cable that already had in my possession worked and am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should need one in the future ,212,4.0

1504,well thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them however not only do they not maintain charge while turned off literally have to charge both after one dies and it not like these things last that long so that pathetic but also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting the mouse still will just flash red and not work got rd to replace the nd but that one was just as bad they are all bad this is waste of money you re better off dealing with batteries than these cheap wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway please don buy because you will be happy with it right until the return window closes ,124,5.0

13617,while it isn on par with some of the more expensive headsets out there for the value that it was give discounted this is good pair of headsets that helps for those that want to get into the video gaming craze this pair of headphones is big so size should be covered for those with big round heads while the game audio is bit filled with bass at times the quality outside of that is really good and the size comes to an advantage again as it helps with noise cancellation both in mic and in speakers if you can get the same deal did recommend it for first timer ,110,5.0
16093,i bought jbl speakers which had high reviews did not know needed to install an app to get them in stereo installed the app confirmed by google play store and cant find it on my computer went to jbl video on youtube for help and they want me to watch two video ads first no thank you this is way too complicated update dont know how this product averages stars have two units that no longer use as went back to wired speakers aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh hear that that is the sound of me no longer being frustrated by wireless speakers the bluetooth lag is simply unacceptable once you figure how to pair the speakers in stereo then you have to press button on each speaker every time you want stereo there is only one active speaker in each unit the battery on one of the units never fully charges takes very long time to charge them if you lived close to me then would give them to you for free no longer want them ,173,1.0

16902,initially my preference was the bose soundlink mini ii with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in small transportable package that is until heard comparison against jbl charge on youtube based on that review and others purchased this speaker for its waterproof multi connect and sound great price you can buy charge direct from jbl for with color options with price point being on par with amazon sounds great excellent better describes it if you have charge there isn enough improvement to justify buying charge the charge went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from hz to deeper hz when the jbl arrived we conducted our own comparison against bose soundlink mini ii and wow the charge is much clearer has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room it bit larger and heavier than the soundlink mini ii which might turn some off but to me if going to carry any speaker like this then taking the same care and am sure can find just little more room good packaging but no instructions not that charging and setup are all that difficult but this is my first device that requires usb first anything that arrived with zero printed information and rechargeable device that arrived with zero anything to charge it with setup was easy bought usb cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for hours since it came somewhat charged already once charged press the bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device for settings always recommend phone volume to be no more than to volume then using the charge volume from there this affords you plenty of up down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn task the internal sound processor this since it cheaper to replace repair charge than an expensive smartphone you and someone else can be bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time battery life the built in rechargeable li ion mah battery is strong not only does it support up to hours of playtime at lowest setting and figure hours at half volume but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the usb port strongly suggest buying protective case for it which will hold your charger usb charging cable and any spare usb cable needed for cell phones it has the same ipx waterproof as iphone samsung or other higher end smartphone we place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills big splashes being left in the rain or even an accidental swim in the pool having that peace of mind alone is priceless jbl connect with connect you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience put in opposing corners of large room in different rooms indoor and outdoors heck even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap bottom line this being my first bluetooth speaker ever and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs bang for buck is spot on have excellent sound in transportable package in wireless speaker that is rugged waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials events and private enjoyment win ,565,5.0

16053,several years ago purchased pair of jbl charge speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool the range was great the sound was great and the batteries lasted long time we eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with pair of jbls latest charge speakers the charge the sound quality and other features are the same but the instability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and link feature are so bad they are unusable have to have my phone within feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect and they constantly cut out loose their connection to each other or pick up static it is so persistent we are not using them anymore deeply regret buying these speakers and wish would have spent less money to but the far superior charge speakers again if you plan to connect two or more speakers together stay away from these because they just don work ,179,5.0

16699,i had high expectations for the jbl charge because it has lot of competition and gets good reviews it not exactly cheap either this implies that the charge should be optimistically almost as good as bose for example unfortunately not call me sonically spoiled use yamaha hs and hs monitors on isolation stands at home my truck has bose system that delivers bass mids and highs like reference system ve heard plenty of bose bluetooth speakers and they ve sounded good used to hearing everything crisp and clear having said all of that many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality it not terrible and it actually sounds good in stereo with two connected together unfortunately it not that simple stereo mode is very unreliable and wonky with single charge the highs and mids sound pretty unappealing the best word can think of to describe its overall sound is flat and sloppy with punchy bass the sound stage is disappointingly one dimensional unless you buy second one and use jbl jbl connect app to run them in stereo stereo mode gives these charge an instant drastic improvement in sound but my speakers switch out of stereo mode and into party mode dual mono every time switch between apps and sometimes just from hitting pause for second this should have never made it past qa at jbl didn know that was happening at first but did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible even with two connected that party mode it two copies of the same sounds right on top of each other don want that want left and right speakers that work reliably stereo mode gives wide stereo image and somehow balances out the lone charge inadequacies bit but can even count on it to work properly to summarize think the charge has potential to make good quality bluetooth audio solution but only if you plan on buying two and only if jbl improves stereo mode functionality right away the app should remember which mode the speakers were on and keep it that way or let us choose default mode either would help tremendously ,362,4.0

16910,sound quality is absolutely great for its size it can really fill space sometimes leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like have whole mini hi fi stereo system in there the bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right place it in corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed it slightly bigger than the charge but probably the price you pay for bigger sound it really hasn affected the portability for me just throw it in my backpack and go it pretty durable haven dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after day at the beach my only gripe is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side so sometimes if you re right in front of the speaker close enough to it you may hear bias towards the left side other than that totally excellent speaker never really charged my phone on it beyond few minutes but it works and the battery life feels super long especially if you re not playing it constantly honestly just excited now waiting to see how jbl is going to improve on this in future models ,233,5.0

11081,ok so just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it the headset is acceptable especially given the current pricetag but it not great it really not have sensitive ears had problems with them relating to heat and pressure so avoided headphones sets for while but eventually saw how for the world of gaming headsets dominate over earbuds so have been on the lookout for comfortable one ever since lil beating around the bush there know no more swear good the top headrest part is very soft and squishy we like this it blue love blue the cord is well made doesn look like it tearing anytime soon bad they re not that comfortable they re not torturous but have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear game sound is very average can hear decently but for games like fortnite that have bad audio to begin with this isn going to change anything ugly don know if this is defect but if you plug this into your phone or tablet and bend the cord lil while on call it ll hang up you watching youtube video cord moves slightly and it skips to the next video you see how infuriating this can be it pronged connection they have added usb connection only for the lights get it but at the same time just remove the lighting no one wants to have usb cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pc the mic doesn mute when you flip it up thought this was an industry standard but apparently not you have to manually mute your mic with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord so that pretty much it honestly you be getting around the same quality with clearance pair at your local electronics store and without the very annoying end call bug would have returned but was too lazy eh it ll work as backup suppose edit bengoo customer service took the initiative and contacted me giving out refund to my amazement was concerned it was possibly scam but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever huge thanks to bengoo for having the service more popular companies should have ,374,1.0

11328,i ordered these for myself my current headset just reached the end of it life and needs replaced these appeared similar and were near the same in price but oh boy the quality first off unless you have an extremely tiny head or are child these are not for you the ear cuffs are absurdly small had my japanese roommate try them on and even he laughed at how ridiculously tiny they were there no way you could wear these for any length of time without getting headache from the pressure to your ears but hey maybe they ll sound great and can get past that nope the audio was muffled and quiet had to turn my volume up five fold to hear anything compared to my worn out set the set that literally falling part sound better come on all of this comes after waiting much longer delivery time than quoted by almost week and when the package did arrive it was crushed headset seemed unharmed but with the sound quality who knows maybe that factor can say all can say is that these are absolute junk ,188,1.0

9641,this keyboard is thoroughly average you press keys and the computer reacts there are no glitches the backlight turns on so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised unless it goes to sleep there is nothing to set this keyboard apart in fact it is lacking in some ways for example there is no way to determine how much batter power you have left which is inexcusable for wireless gaming input device there is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of gaming session they did not even need to write software to display this information windows can display it if the device simply provides it am also not fan of the key layout they got creative with the placement of the backslash key instead of being in its normal position above the enter key they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backslash in between that and enter enter has been stretched up to backspace the end result is that if you try to type backslash or pipe characters say when entering paths or escape characters or coding you wind up hitting the enter key instead possibly times since you re typing without looking on instinct don know how many times have tried to type in path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the os by pressing enter instead of backslash very frustrating the quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying but not quite as bad if you are developer this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone particularly if you then go to work and use keyboards with standard layout maybe others are different but the absolute last thing want in keyboard is less than standard key layout it renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience ,305,3.0

8682,i picked this keyboard since it one of the few out there that still have the old school design with big tall enter button instead of the wide one was very pleasantly surprised with how nice typing feels and how quiet it is these were the main requirements had and happy to say it ticks all boxes only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience instead it has you charging the built in battery with cable which lasts about weeks before needing to recharge it but that was my fault for not paying attention to the description other than that noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys but really this is just nit picking and not noticeable when typing normally overall really very happy with my purchase ,141,5.0

2179,if you are like me and have trouble using usb to usb converters somehow always end up with flaky ones that don maintain connection be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support usb it comes with usb and usb adapter however you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter to use it you cannot use the usb adapter on its own which means have long double adapter sticking out of my computer just waiting to get knocked off had known up front that the usb adapter required the usb adapter to work would not have made this purchase ,103,4.0

9581,haven even used it yet and won keys are all very loose and extremely cheap feeling but for the price it was kind of expected the most disappointing thing about the purchase is the way it was shipped ordered multiple products including few heavy tv mounts which were of course on top of the keyboard and my led lights ups was upset about the weight of the box and told me not to ship heavy items because they will be broken when they arrive if you must order this keyboard make sure you don order anything else at the same time ,101,5.0

11379,this product is amazing the sound is really clear the design make you look like pro gamer this headphone is flexible and it has the cushion for your head the previous ones own are kinda rigid so it normally broke near areas bending occurs one thing not fan of is where the headphone volume controller is placed also the headphone volume controller can sometimes makes the sound off like the left side is little louder then the right side ,79,2.0
3276,love it definitely worth the buy ,6,5.0
628,very nice sleek design was expecting lot more given the reviews but mouse stopped working after weeks the usb and usb adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending so as soon as go to plug it into my computer it does not connect definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for product to use for about week or two ,61,1.0
13052,i purchased three of these gaming headset sets for my kids and the two had the same issue the sound connection is not really the best quality they start off great then after few days of playing the sound becomes problem ,41,5.0
5714,great value comfortable and stylish little mouse ,7,1.0
15272,let me start with what everyone is most interested in these have great sound quality for the size they have better bass than you expect but the treble could be little stronger ve turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well you can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material bought so could output in stereo it bit quirky trying to get them into stereo mode but it does work however for some reason they glitch occasionally which causes dropout when playing in stereo think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers hoping they can come up with firmware update to fix it don have this problem when just using speaker all in all would recommend buying these ,136,1.0
10270,these headphones stopped working after days the mm headphone jack is also loose and not good fit don throw the packaging away ,22,3.0

7450,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly ,172,5.0
16223,terrible just received it charged it didn leave it plugged in after charging when tried it the next day it gliched on and turn off does not turn on now ve read some other reviews and this is apparently happening alot with jbl products coming from amazon ,47,5.0
3806,easy to use great on the hand good product ,9,5.0

10839,i use these for gaming music videos schoolwork pretty much everything spanning both pc and console experiences they work great and still work great after almost year of ownership the chord is tad unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren ideal for noise canceling other than that can find any issues ,52,1.0

745,this mouse works perfectly for what bought it for it ergonomic chic colorful and works long time before needing to be charged it came quickly and was packaged nicely buy with confidence ,32,5.0
11601,no sound canceling these are just regular headphones the audio jack is weirdly thicker than it should be so hard to plug into things and very snug when you do they re very light and cheap but you get what you pay for if you want gaming headphones look elsewhere if you just need headphones with mic these are technically fine ,61,5.0

8306,this is the bang for your buck but before you get too wild about it there are some things you should note after some use the keyboard gets little squeaky dont know if got defective product but for me whenever was trying to press while holding spacebar the would not register leaving me stuck with another inventory slot this makes it really bad for action games because if you were to switch to the second slot you would have to let go of spacebar if those things dont bother you buy this keyboard its amazing ,95,1.0
12993,good sturdy quality great for gaming just got mine in today so far they are worth the money spent noise cancellation isn bad like loud these are bit quiet for me but others in the house thought they were plenty loud ,41,5.0

2625,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech ,74,5.0
12540,quality of it is pretty good,6,5.0
10752,got these today and not sure if should even use them specially after learning most it reviews are fake bought new console along side these and not going to risk losing new controller if the adapter decides to break off inside it like some reviewers say the first red flag for me was definitely the packaging it was packed in large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial there was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use and the worst part is you don even have to use them in game to tell the mic is defective as it won even reach the front of you re face the cord as well as volume slider are bit obnoxious in size and the product overall feels like fragile plastic off brand did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good noticed background static at first which lot of people mentioned but it wasn terrible or even noticeable at times ll probably stash these away for backup pair and just buy name brand pair for the same or even better price and if you are also looking for solid gaming headset then please help yourself and look away from these ,204,5.0
347,does what its meant for,5,5.0

13814,i am year old woman with small head have hard time even finding retail hats that fit me so have horrible time finding any kind of headphones that fit and or are not painful only just got these and on the smallest setting they mostly fit could honestly have them just little smaller and be perfect but at least these are not squeezing my head like vice as so many do the ear pieces go all the way around my ears so they are also not squeezing my ears which is painful think they will be ok for long periods of use because they do not hurt the sound quality seems fine hearing surround sound in my game as type this my voice comes out clear as does those am chatting with it easy to mute myself as well and change the volume right from the headset over all think these are really good quality and great price the lights are pretty although doubt will bother using them since do not stream and only have two usb ports on my laptop anyway ,182,5.0

3304,mouse does not hold charge ,5,5.0
9517,this was purchased for pc that occasionally gets used for gaming but nothing intensive on the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room something have struggled to find in other purchased keyboards second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen have mid high corsair that cannot do that at times the price tag and battery life is way longer than the more expensive corsair my only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the enter return key all of my other keyboards without exception have horizontal return key this one has moved the key with the forward slash mark to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal for touch key typist this creates problem since the pinky finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboards for gamers this is an acceptable inexpensive keyboard and well worth the money for touch typist you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustrating this is an update from original initial review device did not last year and stopped working altogether as did the expensive corsair have gone back to good wired keyboard ,248,4.0

13860,i picked this up so could play the xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide use this headset with my one controller via the plug to play the games enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games the headset fits wonderfully on my ears not too tight not loose however the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home since this is an on the go out in the public headset consider this good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such the headset is light enough to not feel like giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in messenger bag with my phone and controller have thick vinal bag when traveling keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty the sound is adequate on these don expect phenomenal quality sound like high priced headset the audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so can know what direction my team and enemies are in with that being said the glow feature really isn necessary but is very bright and attention getting when plugged into usb port which just runs the led lights in the earphones the bright blue would look really good on live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing for the price paid hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that do through the week ll come back when if they finally break fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability ,278,4.0

17055,this is good unit nice bass good sound but had jbl charge three and do not like that cannot use the same charging wire for the amount of money that you charge for the gpo charge for it should come with its own charge wire should not have to go online and purchase charge wire separately or double usb cord let down,62,1.0

10722,update seller realized left star review and is now spamming me with gift card bribes to remove it if you are wondering how product with so many bad reviews somehow has over star rating it because they bribe buyers with gift cards to delete bad reviews or change them to stars original review purchased bengoo but the headset came in butfulake gh box pics attached no user manual included my mousepad came with more troubleshooting instructions for some reason gaming headset needed both usb plug and an audio jack good ones only need usb my windows pc didn recognize the usb when plugged in all other usb headsets in my household work fine with the same pc the blue ear lights go on but no audio or microphone available apparently you have to use the audio jack to make the sound work but still no working microphone with non functioning usb plug someone clearly tried to pass off their broken leftovers as new no idea how this seller and product became an amazon choice with strong customer ratings very scammy experience serves me right for trying to go cheap on electronics already started the return process ,196,2.0

7434,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks ,117,5.0

11450,overall the set is fine nothing ridiculous you get what you pay for pretty much just needed fair priced pair to replace my blown out ones perhaps my biggest gripe about this product is that the volume knob is total joke there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn on the way to turning it up the majority of the time you re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting the range feels like it begins and ends within less than third of the knob ability to turn in the volume increase direction ,107,2.0

14496,got this speaker as replacement for my original refurbished ue mega boom played that thing full volume on many occasions and after years although still sounding great feel the speaker might have ruptured bit decided to try jbl and didn want to get the charge because of the price and tacky huge jbl in the front think old speaker models offer great value as they sound great and are cheaper so far so good with this jbl plenty loud of course haven been doing full volume yet because cautious due to my previous ue experience love that it sits on its side and love the color we will see how it will hold up but so far great just as expected from jbl ,123,1.0
15357,first of all the speaker is monaural and you need two to get stereo that then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo and there is no app for windows or mac only mobile devices tried an android emulator but you can get to bluetooth that way so forget it the app is crappy too it takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running after while something times out the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re started to make it stereo again the only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don care about stereo sound what waste so good sound or not these are going back both of them ,143,5.0
14589,i brought this speaker as surprise gift for my daughter who has had the bose companion speakers which she enjoyed for years but it was time to upgrade to bluetooth this is our first experience with jbl so did some comparison research between jbl and bose of which we ve had various products over the years the sound is great color beautiful and size perfect begin using it as soon as unpacked it initially thought the charge cord or guide were missing due to the separate packaging being camouflaged in the box black on black should be reconsidered maybe sticker could be added otherwise we are very satisfied with the purchase ,111,5.0

14318,i ve been jbl guy since the shows my age guess my experience with jbl has been great they make great speakers that provide the best sound for the buck in my opinion that said there are so many choices today for speakers many more than years ago it can be difficult to choose if you are looking for great little bluetooth speaker with great sound you can do no better than this jbl charge it pairs very easily and quickly with whatever source iphone or ipad in my case the sound is terrific for such small package other blutetooth speakers have tried can compare in sound or reliability use it on my patio and the range and volume for the area are perfect battery seems to be real plus am still running on the first charge it also rated very well by consumer reports you can go wrong with the jbl charge ,153,5.0

112,i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one ,83,3.0

10992,they feel like cheap plastic and the sound isn that great not fan of the cord either but that personal preference they work if you re looking for cheap headphones and don care edit bought these when they were at least half the price these are not worth dollars,49,1.0
2453,initially was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse it is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse and it worked well however after about two weeks the scrolling wheel became erratic and it stopped working altogether today bit more than three weeks in use as result the mouse became essentially useless and am returning it ,60,5.0

479,the mouse itself was fine at first worked great and liked the shape and sound but the wheel started to squeak and it always scrolled too fast for my liking and now the mouse won work at all always jumping around the screen spinning lagging or unresponsive really annoying when trying to play games it does this when the battery is getting low too not fan it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on and now it won even read on my mousepad at all it has to be on the desktop to make it work even poorly ,110,5.0

15348,sound quality is decent for the price point in the segment one complaint is the lowest volume setting is too loud for an office setting which was the main purpose of my purchase the drivers are ok for the size but don expect to hear all the lows from your music it better than most but for the money rather have spent little more and gotten larger more versatile speaker ,70,5.0

552,does not work,3,5.0
17200,update after year of not so actively using it does not make any sound we did not use it much had to charge battery once or twice in total the last time battery died and after charging it it does not make any sound at all think it was second time had to charge other functions like bluetooth light and buttons are working though tried to upgrade software by downloading and connecting mobile app but no result whatsoever am really disappointed about that do not even know what to do keep it or get rid of it easy to use descent sound quality and battery performance usability bluetooth connection easily discoverable easily usable even for non tech at all peoplesound quality bass and high notes sound clear with very pleasant deep bass battery performance do not know if that is standard but my one was decently charged right from the box and played for several hours non stop without any additional charge battery charges fast and lasts as promised will need special cover holder for it to carry and keep safe comfortablywould highly recommend ,184,5.0
16114,bass is weak volume is low no way to adjust this was more than the oontz angle bt speaker that got three years ago and it not better at all holding down the bt button with the button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down these are not helpful don waste your money on this if you re looking for anything other that very poor bass and it overheats like snowflake in the sun so if you want to take it to the beach don just don buy this ,91,5.0

8400,here are few major issues bought this keyboard for main reasons it was supposed to be ergonomic silent lit up and good qualityergonomic this is not ergonomic it black ordinary keyboard with some lights silent keyboard this is not silent it is the loudest keyboard have had in years lights thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard nope you get to pick how bright it is and whether it solid breathing flickering or off the color pattern never changes the worst part is after seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off which is really problematic when it dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters quality it feels like cheap plastic overall give this stars would not purchase it again ,132,4.0

9098, update after yr of usage used the keyboard almost everyday for whole year mostly for work rather than gaming and it is still like new then one day had to switch out my laptop at work and forgot to take the usb receiver before turning it in unfortunately couldn retrieve it and was beating myself up for it going back to using the laptop keys was highly excruciating so decided to take chance and ask if the usb receiver was replaceable their customer service is phenomenal the same rep communicated with me throughout the process have you ever played hot potato with customer service then you know how amazing this feels and she always responded pretty quickly to my emails there was never lag time the only hiccup ran into was at the very beginning when searched for customer service portal through amazon the initial link connected me with the klim technical riding gear rather than klim technologies however they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there they told me the usb receiver is replaceable yayyyy but that part was on backorder was more happy to know be able to continue using the keyboard so was willing to wait month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me new one it arrived as promised and can go back to typing comfortably and with lightening speed just got it and have only used it for couple of hours but thoroughly impressed by this keyboard smooth buttons smooth typing comfortable feel and full sized buttons and now have number key pad the presentation was also impressive black little envelope with seemingly personalized note with little flare from the makers when you open the box love it just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play the keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as type hope it lasts forever ,336,5.0
13003,i like this headset really do after about an hour of wearing the headset it starts to hurt my ears little bit not that the volume is too loud but maybe because have big head and big ears for the price the quality is great the seller did everything as promised and shipping was on point ,56,5.0

13725,this headset was amazing to use the sound quality is excellent and all of my friends use it and love it would definitely get this again if needed ,28,1.0
5960,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review ,246,5.0

4115, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times ,186,1.0

10379,the headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and usb connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the usb is connected to power source poor design of the cord ,93,4.0

9754,i originally ordered this keyboard just over years ago and was and still am very happy with the product the product is lightweight the keys feel nice and they are pretty quiet like that it has the separate number pad but the whole keyboard is not too large or bulky the rechargeable battery lasted longer than expected so was able to take advantage of the wireless feature when the battery does die you can still use the keyboard while it is plugged in and charging and the battery light on the top right corner turns off when its charged the rainbow colour lights behind the keys are nice touch too am not gamer though so have no comment on its features for that purpose just recently the battery started to die more frequently and had to plug it in more often which was not the end of the world for me as most keyboards require cords anyway however the battery eventually started to expand and the keyboard warped and became unusable went back to my amazon order and checked to see if there was warranty and there was years reached out to customer service via email with pictures of the keyboard and my original invoice they responded within the same day and offered me replacement have the replacement now and still love it the company has provided exceptional customer service they were very responsive and they stand behind their product they even checked in with me to make sure that received the replacement and that it was working as expected ,260,4.0

14766,so originally was introduced to jbl speakers when the charge first came out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been telling any and everyone come across that when ever in question go with jbl so this last christmas someone baught me the jbl flip and was just confused the sound quality the base even the bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song returned no problem only wanted replacement anyway received the second one and again like the jbl look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the charge so after getting refund from the second flip spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the sound that made me fan to begin with if you re just trying out jbl speakers would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the charge models see that the flip and have almost perfect rating on amazon so maybe it just my opinion but believe the quantity all around of the charge is better representative of the jbl brand the battery in the charge seems to drain quicker than the flip but put my speaker threw it passes from the moment turn it on in the morning until am ready to relax in the evening literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth connection no problem at all the sound quality is just awesome love music period believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe or pushes of the button if you re listening to sax or blues guitar albert king for example it only gets better the higher you go garth brooks or lauren daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard man can wait till can get enough for the extreme or the boom box hope this was helpful to someone god bless,402,5.0
1938,loved the product look and that it was rechargeable however the battery didn hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use returning item and going back to logitech brand ,70,5.0

11589,a pretty decent headset bought this headset having very very high hopes for the mic specifically since my audio hadn been the best just through my laptop microphone but after using this headset for month or two have realized that the mic isnt actually that great it is mediocre at best and it commonly cuts out in voice calls the headset audio quality itself is honestly pretty good the mute and volume wheel were very convenient and you could really make your audio very loud with the volume wheel which was plus will say though that the led lights on the headset wont light up unless you plus the usb jack in which was big inconvenience for me when was still using wired mouse and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe just forgot to check the slides when buying this headset is also very very bulky which is personal ick for me when buying headsets its definitely not for minimalistic look but will say this is just personal preference overall its mediocre headset since its only you get what you pay for but theres definitely better headsets out there for the same price or save up just bit more money for highquality medium priced headset like the razer kraken steelseries arctics or hyperx cloud alpha headset ,221,2.0

16031,i have both of these speakers and like them both here the long and short of it so you don have to research million reviews the charge is larger louder and has more bass like this one because don care about the miniscule differences in quality of mid high low that won be noticed anyways since this is speaker for pools parties etc the charge is smaller less expensive and has truer sound where the quality comes across as slightly but noticeably higher it not as loud and doesn have as much bass as the charge which sounds noticeably less authentic than the charge unless you re tech guy the deal with drivers mono vs stereo etc doesn matter all that much do you want louder bassier speaker that can be heard from further distance on bike ride around campfire etc get the charge do you want truer more authentic sound at lesser price get the charge ,157,5.0

17217,i upgraded from jbl flip that couldn hold charge after about years was hesitant about buying speaker that has only driver but so far have zero complaints run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges give it it has huge battery that will certainly last you for hours have currently used it for roughly hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near full charge only time will tell another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same jbl connect feature other coworkers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into party would highly recommend this speaker if you re looking for something that puts out high volume and has great battery life ,145,3.0
13540,i bought this for my ps and it great headset with lot of utility for entertainment and chat would recommend to all ,22,2.0
465,was decent first month very flat so not ergonomic but that personal taste issue is this is already broken the scroll wheel no longer works even for mouse that pretty pathetic since ve had other mouses for years at time had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor ,63,1.0
10663,i ll be honest at such low price didn have big expectations was ready to try them and send them back if didn like them positives the sound quality is actually really good and it does block out ambient noise they are comfortable don think they are too heavy some of the wireless headphones hurt after awhile one reason choose wired negatives it had volume control and although nice to have it adds weight to the cord so have to make sure put the volume control in my lap or else it pulls on the headphones and it heavy the mic only moves up and down which wish it could move away or towards your mouth too overall for the price these are nice ,124,2.0
3034,made very cheap broke the second it was too late to return it guess got what paid for save your money and buy better quality mouse ,26,5.0

4207,works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse ,89,5.0

2567,came ready to use starting using straight from box it is convenient and ergonomic friendly ,15,1.0
17323,i love the ruggedness of this speaker its punchiness and especially the fact that you can link together devices however you must upgrade the firmware to version it easy to do with the app do it when first got this device the sound quality was awful on low volumes it was like there was some kind of gating effect enabled that ate quiet sounds what worse when held it up to my eat could still hear digital noise from the bluetooth connection at low volumes it gave kind crackling effect yikes as last resort tried upgrading the firmware wasn too hopeful because the changelog said fixes minor bugs lol well it turns out that it fixed the low volume gating effect which consider to be major blocker like to listen to quiet music at night so this was huge relief whew i,142,4.0
11709,bought for use with xbox hard to get connected but that blame lies squarely with microsoft ,16,5.0
15278,love it ,2,5.0
12420,just got them but they lin very nice used my adapter to listen to movie good sound good noise cancelling ll update my review as use them more ,28,4.0
17007,this is an amazing sounding speaker it has good base but not overpowering the sound is clear and deep it is mono speaker but can be paired with second one for stereo use it at work and am rarely able to go past half way at full volume with an iphone not sure if it matters it never distorts or sounds scratchy ,62,5.0
4123,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse ,96,5.0
16756,way better than expected but still amazing speaker can change my phone don turn the vol to the max because want life of the speaker we go camping lot so far it lasted good hrs of nonstop music play vol medium high and did good along with charge two iphones xr and xs can complain at all ,57,5.0
11041,great price great sound can hear everything on xbox the headache part is the mic stops working st stop they replaced them now the replacement doing the same thing anyone else has this problem ,34,5.0
7171,love how soft and quiet it is super happy ,9,5.0
3237,i love this mouse if you have smaller hands or like mouse that doesn feel to big in your hands then this is for you the color and lights are cool touch as well ,34,5.0
10303,horbile never worked be careful they fool u,8,5.0
9503,so far my husband is loving it would prefer non colored mode ,12,3.0
5914,i would have loved this product if my hands weren so picky and plus it was bit too flat for gaming on pc works fine very silent clicks still if you aren used to flat mouse don buy it,39,1.0
2836,this product broke in days,5,5.0
1696,multi use can use this mouse for anything you need to get done smooth slick and overall perfect performance ,19,2.0
10455,this product was little disappointing to be honest for one wish had paid attention to the fact that this is not wireless second the lights don come on with mic jack which sure it wouldn make sense to but it really should have just been usb with an adaptor otherwise if you don care about lights it works fine say it better suited for pc gaming since usually there mic jack next to usb port but not for consoles its not the worst just the sound quality is kind of minimal it doesn play music too well it can get loud but then the sound gets shrill amd will induce headach truthfully wouldn buy this again ,116,1.0
12578,the microphone is literally ass trash asf when went to go turn my mic on it didn work and tried multiple times the headset didn work either because of the jack so it trash,34,5.0
9252,sucks that buys you keyboard that just dies after couple weeks know this only happens to some people that buy the product so if you wanna roll the dice go ahead ,31,1.0
14860,absolutely love it,3,5.0
4232,works great and looks classy ,5,5.0
12689,great overall broke too quickly but that just might be cause the kids use the heck out of it ,19,5.0
11478,these headphones are great for gaming with my friends like that the microphone folds up and it works perfectly with my ps would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but wanted to make it clear that they aren active noise cancellation headphones ,54,5.0
11321,these are pretty good if you aren looking for long term they work great but mine only lasted few months before just completely giving out randomly,26,5.0
6788,i got this because our child sleeps while work the mouse is super quiet pro quiet lef right buttons adjustable sensitivity micro usb is easy to charge and doesn interfere with mouse use color changes usb doesn disconnectcons middle button click is louder color can be set it rotates it be cool if could lock it in for this price it pretty good purchase ,64,3.0
12763,i was really impressed with these headphones they are great canceling out other noise and can hear things in game that never even noticed when played through the tv speakers great purchase ,32,5.0
61,i hated this item they described how easy it was to use and received mine and it does not connect after doing my research on it its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not so now have to order different one im very disappointed in this product ,50,1.0
9908,the cushion material is very uncomfortable after few minutes of wear it feels like your ears get hot quickly it seems it would have been easy to cover foam ear piece with more breathable material sound quality is great and the microphone seems to be perfect but sound quality means absolutely nothing if it is too uncomfortable to wear ,59,1.0
16358,overall the speaker is great it is quite bit hefty but that is to be expected with all the rubber keeping it waterproof as well as the rest of the hardware inside the battery life is pretty spot on with about hour of constant usage and the sound is clear and loud very much worth the purchase and if you catch it on sale even more so ,67,5.0

2469, while the product looks great it not very ergonomic for me noticed pain in my hands after only few days of usage not great for long period usage ,28,4.0
10142,the design is nice but these headsets aren worth it it use to light up when plugged in and play sounds loudly when first got it but not anymore the sound has to much bass and staticky from the beginning the microphone would not work despite following the instructions to turn it on so just used it for work to hear notifications when stepped away my computer won recognize the headset anymore even when the lights are turned on just prop now ,82,1.0
934,i was using this mouse to play sims on my mac book and it was working great for about month and then yesterday all of sudden it just flatlines the only light that comes on is when turn it on ve tried to unplug turn on and turn off the mouse even went as far as to reboot my computer swear to god of the seller emails me to take this down gonna go off this item is terrible do not buy ,82,1.0

9317,it fairly bright but you re stuck with the one rainbow color pattern and some of the colors are not as bright as others making typing in the dark harder than it should be the keys are raised up and beveled like keyboard from years ago so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards this makes typing and accuracy little slower some of the keys are placed little weird too the key to the left of the enter key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark this one has the backslash and vertical line as was used to my last keyboard kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be ll likely be replacing this soon ,116,3.0

12288,this headset is great for gaming and basically anything else it has volume switch so you don have to bend over your keyboard to press the volume button and you can change the volume as well my favorite part is the cushion at the top my last pair of headphones were very uncomfortable but now my head feels lot better because of it and it also has headset microphone so you can chat with friends the only downside is that the cord is very long and it so it can sometimes get in the way if you re playing game but all in all these are great high quality headphones for very cheap price this was written by my year old son who plays games on pc and other platforms he loves these heaphones ,134,5.0
16186,i got this speaker to upgrade from my old ue boom well would say the only things it does better is battery life and little more volume when you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the highs and the speaker is very directional so it very difficult to find location for the speaker that doesn turn it into shrill little squeak box the ue have is much smaller speaker but it has nearly degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles all in all the jbl definitely wasn worth the money sticking with ue ,108,5.0

8747,i do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in dark room otoh those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly so it isn really wireless keyboard it best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time but that true of basically all wireless lighted keyboards the big problem had was that it just never got along with my computer mac running big sur several times day would have to unplug the wireless dongle shut off the keyboard and then plug in and power up again even then sometimes had to restart the computer after week or so of that gave up and returned the keyboard ,114,5.0

14973,i have always loved jbl products and this speaker doesn disappoint whatsoever for portable bluetooth speaker this thing bumps like can hear it all over bed bath house for an apartment your neighbors might get mad if it too high the battery life is really good with many hours of use even at higher volume levels which drains the battery much faster the sound quality is awesome with great bass and clarity bluetooth connection is quick and easy and you can go pretty far away with your phone in your pocket and it won skip beat and of course it called the charge cuz you can charge other electronic devices with the usb charging plus that dope addition to an already great speaker finally the value for the money spent to purchase this and it definitely worth it price and then some the charge is and got this charge open box brand new for that an insane deal thanks to amazon haha my favorite bluetooth speaker of all time ,169,4.0

5339,the type extension doesn work so it rendered it useless for my mac am able to use it on my pc for work just not the intended use bought it for the mouse itself is great light easy to use fits perfectly in my hand always connects and is reliable ,50,5.0
3767,the usb plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the usb out but the case stays inside the port it still useable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the usb plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as backup for my work laptop so don use it as much as use my gaming mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable ,146,5.0

9925,bought for my son he is not easy on them but so far they are keeping up,17,1.0
14206,you cannot turn the speaker off without it making loud noise they know it annoying it meant to get you to install the app if you install the app giving up more of yourself to them in other words they let you turn it off think it meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to and cannot hear anything else it will still make loud noise when turning off they want you to not be able to turn it off quietly for example when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on want to turn it off quietly works fine otherwise the one star is just cause think it fair to penalize such behavior ,128,5.0

15293,i ve had this speaker for well over year now use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the patio ve had it connected to my smaller tv that move between porch and patio but my sony works better for that due to the sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the jbl app it still looks and works as good as when first got it battery lasts good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size especially if its placed against wall or better yet in an inside corner have been very happy with its quality and performance now some negative aspects the battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out the base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off table if bumped speakers are on the ends so you can stand it up vertical it does make loud melodic sound when turned off it is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of case adds no value is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative suggest getting one without the case the current price is much much more percent more than when purchased it maybe due to covid price gouging or just rampant inflation never buy used product that requires built in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new ,275,5.0

16401,totally shocked at how clear sounding it is it definitely gets loud was very impressed with the life of battery however now know why it last if you are not playing anything after awhile it automatically shuts itself off kind of nice feature we like it because of the bluetooth and use it while driving in our rv we have an older motorhome and it doesn have fancy radio with gps or bluetooth so this portable speaker works great however using gps google maps from phone is nice but while traveling it may only speak an hour later well the speaker will shut itself off if nothing comes through in an hour so to fix that we just listen to sirius via bluetooth by phone and when google gps needs to give directions it just cuts through music to announce what ever so it works out great ,147,5.0

5578,sadly the roller ball stopped working ,6,1.0
9279,well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die have not had to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect ,97,5.0

7218,very nice mouse enjoy the colorful addition ,7,5.0
9388,only thing don like about it is that the cable included in the package is only for charging rather than for charging and wired use you must use the wireless adapter for it to work not huge deal but it would be nice if wired use was an option it would make sense ,53,5.0
16677,if it werent for the battery life and ability to charge other devices would give this bass response and loudness is ok definitely not bad its better indoors than outdoors waterproofness is exceptional spilled cup of starbucks on it and it was unfazed hahaha its lil chunky if ya got big hands its not problem to carry around but it is hefty in weight just wished it had sound ,69,5.0

5885,work great like the lights,5,5.0
14759,i placed the device on shelf and kept it there after opening after days of use for about minutes each day without any disturbance the sound all of sudden started to crackle all mid and low range frequencies were gone performed hard reset multiple times per the instructions without any change ,51,5.0
1324,i bought this for working at home general use was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when didn have any works great for general use and battery lasts while but haven done any button mashing games with it my only complaint is the usb remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage you have to dig with your nail to remove it small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse ,81,4.0
10954,very cool my brother loved it,6,5.0
6994,the charging cord is so short and flimsy it won stay connected to both pieces so it is difficult to get full charge the mouse does not hold charge after be left on the charger overnight it is dead within five minutes use ,43,5.0
8602,the keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice the keyboard is functioning correctly as am typing the review right now however the design itself has some problems if were to describe the feeling of typing on it it feels somewhat sticky as though am typing into quicksand this is likely because for the design to be quiet it blunts the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position honestly wouldn have minded the noise if it meant better typing experience as it feels like actually expending effort to type each key the charger port also has issues with the male usb cable plugging in it has lots of resistance and only goes in like mm with exposed metal when the charge is active all in all think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is godsend but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction ,150,5.0
661,works well with windows ,4,5.0
1216,the scroll wheel broke in the exact same way twice in the last months we opened the mouse up and it not simple fix so the first time we replaced it but this time we re just going with different brand,41,1.0

15099,this thing is terrific it has shocking amount of bass for small speaker jbl pretty much nailed the design if were to complain it would be that the base is little narrow use the speaker by my pool and dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool again for you people that are complaining about it being mono its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas do you have to have stereo drivers that will be inches apart is that really needed of course not if that bothers you there are ton of other devices that might be better fit but doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas have an old bt stereo speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the charge going mono delivers more volume longer battery lower heat and simplified controls bass sucks power this thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers ton of bass stream to it in the backyard when swimming in the pool it has really been great it has been accidentally kicked into the pool few times but no damage and it has proven to be water resistant as advertised ,203,5.0
8319,ergonomically it nice little clickier than expected the lights aren as bright as expected and the charge seems to be not very long had it unplugged for about an hour and not constantly typing and just had to plug it in as it seemed to be not registering keystrokes feel paid way too much,54,3.0
15504,battery won hold charge the first one failed within days and was replaced the second one failed one week after days and out of the support period ,27,5.0

17182,update definitely noticeable sound differences between the speakers the model is flatter and doesn get as loud as the model it also has muffled sound to it so far have received bad customer service from jbl the seller bought from electronics expo an authorized dealer has week return policy so outside of that and thus far jbl won even admit they are selling different models to customers sent pictures and even links to fcc filing pages and the customer service reps don even acknowledge it they want me to do factory resets and firmware updates it different hardware all they offered me was some coupon and told me to deal with the seller this is the last time ll ever purchase jbl product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well original pictures included just so people are aware there are different models of the actual speaker you may get with this it seems legitimate based on the fcc filings page but want people to understand in case they notice differences like did when put them side by side the model number on the box itself is the same jblchargeblkam but jbl is shipping different speakers inside the box and not telling people there is model and model the boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small qr code next to the serial number on the model if you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the serial number you will see which one you have now if you only order one speaker you probably never know but if you order of them and receive different models the differences are obvious charges the looks to be the older model according to fcc filings this has mah battery inside from my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all it also feels bit heavier in the hand don have digital scale to measure exactly but it definitely more dense the charging indicator lights are also much brighter you can see this in the pictures chargej the seems to be the newer model this is the model that actually has mah battery inside the mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside also the charging lights on this model are much dimmer compared to the it feels bit lighter in the hand as well haven put them through the ringer yet to see if there are audio differences it would be very disappointing if there are so buyer beware jbl is selling different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different but they are marketing it as the same product wish would have known this before bought them ,467,5.0

11025,i bought these about year ago and when received them they appeared to be fine but when used them the cord is heavy thick and tugging the worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindle and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself used them for about hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and noticed in video clip saved the microphone cut out randomly but audio still coming through the headset and was confused because never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tangling asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn realized that he bought the same pair but figured give them another shot once again they tangled themselves to death one day and realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are if there is anything in this review you note down do not but these headphones the worst part is them tangling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord quite embarrassing for the company to own such terrible product ,227,4.0

3003,the mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand the clicking is quiet the only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so have to keep it plugged in which defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse ,44,2.0
15259,i am blown away at how poor this product truly is at first thought it didn work at all because there was no sound but apparently half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked once getting the product working turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music had to download an equalizer app just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle took it to work the next day with full charge and went to use it and again no sound turned it off and took it home still with full battery went to try it again few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off overall am impressed with not one thing about this speaker and you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product have better success buying one from the dollar store do not buy ,165,2.0

8328,great keyboard for the price love the feel though somehow do feel it isn as hefty when typing than used to some people might like this light feel prefer heavier response when click work from home coder so use it on average minimum hours daily it lasted approx days on single charge not bad at all if you charge it overnight once week you shouldn have any problems with it dying randomly the auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery but when working it can be like off putting that the lights go out vs them constantly being on ,101,3.0

5969,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price,101,1.0

14898,i bought this and originally gave it perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not after less than days it quit charging and quit working called amazon who offered refund when purchased it it was they told me they would refund me and then could order new one and now they are when it worked it works great but it just did not last long on amazon did not really do any favors with replacing sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over asked for replacement and they told me no they gave me refund and told me to re order so that they instead so sure they can make more money not happy and very unimpressed do not recommend buying the speaker through amazon because amazon seems to be the crappy one here go buy it at costco who will honor the same price and replace it ,166,5.0
2578,this mouse is good for its price its light and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice when you press down it more of subtle soft click which like lot rather than an annoying and loud click however it does feel little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low when using the led mode you can practically see inside the mouse once again though for it not bad like it because can connect it to my macbook air too which uses an usb ,89,5.0

109,i loved this little mouse it looked great it felt great in my hand the wheel was nice for scrolling the battery even held charge for what thought was reasonable amount of time would categorize my usage as light moderate use and no abuse then came the day about month after arrival right after the return window closed that it started glitching now it drops off not responding then will work again then drop off again and not talking about sleep mode this is during active use back and forth back and forth it frustrating probably more because so desperately want mouse instead of my laptop trackpad all that said didn spend whole lot of money on this mouse so get what pay for just wish had gotten little more than month before the glitching ,135,2.0

8757,i wanted to get wireless backlit keyboard for my home pc something could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer this keyboard looks great the keys themselves have nice travel for easy typing and the charge lasts for very long period of time but the lack of an always on feature for the backlit is very annoying understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly but this is rechargeable keyboard so losing some time to have to charge isn big deal for me it just feels odd that they wouldn just add an always on function for those who would want that often reviewing other peoples work or just reading through instructions so often don type for seconds at time so the lights are constantly going off again understand the reason and it not huge problem but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added overall good keyboard but unfortunately for me it just not good fit for how use my keyboard ,179,5.0

1835, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work ,154,5.0

17221,the jbl charge is great product found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature have found that the highs aren totally accurate but they re close enough to not distract you from the music the highs are present but definitely aren strong which adds to the warm signature the mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device because of this the vocals are great in most songs they are well represented unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear slight distortion from accuracy however the vocals which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic if you listen to high quality hifi tracks you ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage as for the mono speaker don listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don know what they re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don like the thought of it you re not going to get stereo by using speakers inches apart like on the last model and as for separation this mono speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows the speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the way to just under full volume ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge xb xb xb extreme onyx and what ve found is that while the highs are bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments the bass is very good in the charge the bass notes are represented accurately and it able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can however it worth mentioning it still no sub this speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies the radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don know this doesn sound very good the battery life of this speaker wasn as advertised and found could only get hours on percent volume which isn bad but is huge deviation from the claimed hours after using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers ve actually grown fond of this unit and it become my beach toy don take any critics in this review too seriously as doubt most people are as critical as me when it comes to audio but this one gets my thumbs up future improvements would definitely require tweeter and possibly bigger battery ,460,4.0
4617,it works well,3,5.0

6501,update not sure why but this mouse is working better than it did when originally purchased it back in october use it every day and don mind charging it over night every couple of days or so it is comfortable to use and kind of funky in good way to use the changing lights feature from time to time naturally this will make the battery run down faster but once in while enjoy the light show lol and love how the click is so quiet they say they ve upgraded this product so hope you ll give it try too original review october my use of this mouse consists of following hours of use without the pretty little alternating lights on and then it switched off for the night before my next hours are over this thing runs out of life and must be charged again not at all thrilled with it it does have nice quiet click but if have to charge it every time use it don think it will last very long ,175,5.0

13862,these ended up being bit of disappointment we got them for our son for christmas and we didn realize that in order for the lights to work the cord also needs to be plugged into usb port he was using them mostly with tablet so this was bummer now only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don work at all these have had extremely light wear and tear never leaving the house and only used for couple hours day ,83,4.0

8565,this keyboard works exactly as expected though it says it quite keyboard its fair amount louder than silent keyboard like the logitech one the led are nice and able to adjust the brightness find this helpful because work in dark room at my pc the dongle is able to connect easily and has good reception the keystrokes are reliable and the keyboard well built with not completely smooth keys personally like the small amount of texture on the keys the keyboard also goes to sleep after maybe minute to save battery life charged it when got it and have been using it for days with heavy use of those days all in all solid keyboard for reasonable price ,118,5.0

382,about weeks after return window closed quit working completely should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day spent lot of time fooling around with mouse tool that should be something you don have to think about or make plans to be available for use going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about year and no hassle ,65,1.0
3749,really like this mouse never thought say that it stores the usb port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces it quiet click which appreciate even when working alone and the rainbow lighting is optional win win win it light too as it rechargeable carry it with my laptop and it made working on the go better,68,5.0

5280,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked don feel as though this will be adequate for long term gaming but it ll be alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the price couldn ask for much more but do think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reviews you have to connect the receiver to the adapter it takes good bit of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve been more clear about that but it whatever ,113,1.0
348,this mouse worked for while but then broke the led looked fake and crappy wouldn buy this if were but if are in budget it would do the job just be very careful with it ,35,1.0

2945,works great,2,5.0
7585,nice and soft but the laser isn very accurate,9,2.0
974,my first concern is that it does not give you warning when it needs recharging it just dies out if you are using your usb for something else you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse second the charge does not last long very frustrating and now the most important it died just stopped working oh well so much for fancy going back to battery operated mouse ,72,5.0
10795,perfect sound and quality perfect for those who are looking good headset ,12,1.0

12616,purchased for my son to use for talking to his friends while playing video games works well and he can hear them clearly he does not hear us calling him for dinner so would say the noise cancellation is good too ,41,1.0
2640,the design is pretty but the functionality is crappy my mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the nd floor last week ,61,1.0
1906,the scroll wheel on the mouse broke after less than week of using it liked the mouse before that it was easy to setup comfortable to use and the colors look nice really liked the silent mouse click but now that can scroll with the mouse will need to buy new one,52,3.0
5038,decent mouse looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the cheapness of the mouse cursor tracking is the biggest issue the cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the dts button doesn seem to do anything for controlling this ,49,5.0
7043,i loved the design and cool light features but true to the old saying you get what you pay for this mouse was pretty bad it jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button or times before it responds to your request very frustrating to say the least not good buy ,59,1.0
12780,the brand is much cleaner than most products of similar quality ,11,4.0

16049,i read lot of reviews across many sites as was trying to select portable bluetooth speaker for pool days in our back yard and also for our river camping trips the charge is waterproof so even better for our two primary uses was originally going to go with ultimate ears megaboom speaker until read about the jbl charge products and so glad did pretty particular about getting quality sound our of my home speakers computer speakers and headphones and very happy with what hear from the jbl charge for it size the sounds is amazing and very full with good bass but not overpoweringly so if you have an amazon echo of google smart speaker the sound from the charge blows those away the bluetooth syncing is super easy too if you ve ever had bluetooth syncing issues with other devices you know the irritation talking about that comes from that the charge sync to of our phones with ease definitely worth your consideration if you re looking for portable bluetooth speaker ,172,5.0
16647,easy to set up stable on most surfaces charging cord could be longer perhaps feet long ,16,5.0
3974,i purchased this mouse because was tired of having to uninstall and re install bluetooth mouse was using this mouse is very responsive fits nicely in my small hand and is an excellent buy for the price the battery lasts and turns itself off after no use for awhile ,49,4.0

3546,satisfied,1,4.0
4806,the mouse itself was fine at first worked great and liked the shape and sound but the wheel started to squeak and it always scrolled too fast for my liking and now the mouse won work at all always jumping around the screen spinning lagging or unresponsive really annoying when trying to play games it does this when the battery is getting low too not fan it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on and now it won even read on my mousepad at all it has to be on the desktop to make it work even poorly ,110,5.0
1548,it looked fine and worked fine initially but after three months of careful use the right button stopped working correctly it acts now as the button is permanently pressed wish could replace or return but it isn possible anymore ,39,5.0
10492,has cool look and very comfortable but after just few days it stopped working it sucks because ordered this head of time for my son for easter and unfortunately the return window has closed so out and my son has no headset ,42,5.0
10732,overall great headset sound is great built well lights are bright has mute toggle switch on wire along with volume control was leery of getting headset with lights for only but these have been the best headset have ever used they arrived quickly and the box was in great shape when first took them out of the packaging thought had ordered the wrong kind because of the audio jack and usb hook up portion but after little bit of examination realized the usb was for the lights tested them on my phone first and oh my gods the audio is so crisp and clear play call of duty vanguard with these and can hear footsteps from across the map however still die due to my bad aim lol they work great on computers as well on max volume can hear them in my hallway when they are in my bedroom ,150,4.0

2533,this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation ,53,2.0

6160,i liked the sleep mode price is reasonable also liked the shape ,12,1.0
9257,pros the physical design of the keyboard is great feedback on the keys is good has nice matte finish lights are as advertised and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill liquid on it it can drain cons couple times days the keyboard will disconnect intermittently on me it will become unresponsive and disconnect then reconnect rapidly its not for very long maybe seconds to couple minutes and if at the computer for hours day it will only happen couple times but if in the middle of game it can be quite frustrating never have had this issue with other wireless keyboards not sure what the solution is but tried reinstalling the driver ,125,2.0

10518,the good the price and they work the bad very short coord more suited for laptop user than desktop requires both usb and mm ports to be used for either to work disconnect one and headset stops very poor sound its too quiet forget noise cancellation you can hear your phone ring on medium with these on full sound on youtube for some reason the left ear is hotter than the right side assuming because mic is on the left side have bought headphones half this price from sades that had much better sound and coord length but sadly they didnt have red and black anymore should of went with blue and black this headset was twice as expensive and nothing to be happy about will not buy another from this company,132,1.0

1217,when bought this mouse loved it it took me few tries to get it paired right but it is game changer for my laptop the rechargeable battery life on it is great found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly that it was time to charge it purchased it late september and at the end of april my roller has stopped working randomly it worked and then went to use it an hour later and it no longer does the scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop disappointed ,92,1.0

8477,this company deserves stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service this company truly stands by their product my klim keyboard stopped working after about years since they had year warranty reached out and they quickly responded they asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them they would refund the shipping cost and they would also send me new replacement keyboard in the meantime however realized really don care for this keyboard layout don use this keyboard for gaming it primarily for work so the short enter key was irritating at times unlike standard keyboard this one has three keys in between the and enter keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboards so declined their replacement offer didn want to go through the shipping hassel for replacement that don care for was just going to cut my loss look for something else and thought that was the end of it however they immediately offered me full refund or the option to try the upgraded version that has the standard layout the light opted for the latter the keys in the upgraded version are very quiet and feels bit mushy but it works great and highly recommend this company you can definitely purchase with confidence they really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch they were extremely caring easy quick and hassel free ,236,1.0

6354,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it ,273,1.0

1699,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse ,134,5.0

2712,the ergonomics are good but it has fatal flaw that makes it unusable when you first turn it on it works fine but after minutes or so it becomes very twitchy or jerky and completely unusable tried it on both macs and pcs same problem with both systems it too cheap to bother sending back but want to warn others not to make the same mistake ,66,5.0
2061,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty ,148,1.0

15861,this is great speaker with great battery life and great bluetooth connectivity to our samsung and chromebook and the jbl app does firmware updates over bluetooth love it the reason for losing one star is its charging behavior bought this to have it in one location constantly connected to charger and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery for some reason the speaker charges fully the leds indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it fully charged but then after some time the leds turn on again and the th led starts blinking to indicate that it charging and stays that way all this while the speaker sits there connected to the charger without being turned on the leds are very bright which makes it more annoying ,134,4.0

12843,after year of using these headphones am finally going to get rid of these that not to say it bad it just not for me after year these still work great even though they ve fallen too many times to count the audio is fine but everything else is lacking straight out of the box the microphone levels were too low so had to already go to my sound panel and microphone boost it to db could hear my voice nice and clear but it picked up just about everything else in my room not to mention that it also picked up the sounds from the speakers inside the earcups made it impossible for me to play in voice chat with friends because you would hear double the audio now onto the build quality of the headset you get what you pay for am pretty small person kinda sad and this headphone was still too small for me it hurt my ears and the sides of my heads for dollars it decent set of headphones but recommend you buy something better ,181,5.0

8947,this keyboard is excellent would buy it again use it for gaming have no complaints in that regard have set up where my pc is in another separate room from my bedroom it connected to my tv via foot hdmi power cables even through the wall it still manages to get good reception with minimal lag occasionally if positioned really far away in my bedroom on my bed rather than in my gaming chair it will have some brief noticeable lag but if turn it off turn it on again it goes back to normal this issue won be problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their pc don want to don like the noise however small that any pc makes the biggest issue have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the rgb is on it this high pitched squealing sound it goes away as soon as the rgb is turned off this isn problem for me since don care about rgb one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery but everytime the keyboard turns on the rgb is automatically on and hence the sound is immediately there when turn it on and have to turn it off everytime which is minor inconvenience then again probably have to do turn it off anyways since turn off the lighting to save battery but the sound is noticeable it not as loud as computer fan or anything but since it high pitched you won not notice it ,259,1.0
16131,awesome speaker that plan on purchasing again for myself the one bought was for my girlfriend but hours battery life is straight up lie did mention the speaker sounds great with great bluetooth range and controls love this thing so much also my girlfriend probably doesn know the best practices of maintaining the longest battery life possible ,57,3.0

756,the good has separate usb dongle that stores away and charges internally ie no need for battery the bad the mouse tracking is very erratic too fast too slow and could not find setting that suited me but what renders it unusable for me is the click latency have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work or end up dragging something don mean to some people may also find this mouse bit too small ymmv up to one taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display either just red or it switches colors wish you could turn it off though which unfortunately you can ,112,1.0

5602,i have held back writing review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after while it has not been the case for me have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact would recommend the mouse ,58,5.0
3389,love it ,2,5.0

13851,yeah know it relatively cheap but didn expect it to be that feeble the sound and recording quality is pretty bad might as well just talk through laptop open mic even with software noise suppression the listening quality is pretty awful worthless for music listening the mic itself is has poor response and acquisition then there the usb which is only used to light the headset leds up really just shabby ,71,4.0

11586,i bought these head phones for my year old grandson and he loves them he loves the noise canceling feature and the lighting up in blue is an extra bonus ,30,4.0
8741,the back light is very nice some of the top keys don have the clearest numbering lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer one charge lasts long time and you can still use the keyboard while it plugged in for charging the charging cable isn very long but can easily be combined with usb extension cord the ergonomic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use ,84,3.0
3286,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer ,279,5.0

2959,i just got the item and to be honest didn expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews thought it was relatively good the clicking tends to stick mine and tried doing cps clicks per second test and out of the time clicked the test only registered can say it wasn the tests fault since have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything for everyday work won say recommend it but it enough for that but for gaming do not recommend this since of your clicks won work because the mouse itself isn that great quality ,104,5.0

4922,purchased may th and usb broke apart by july th save your money ,13,4.0
10261,this is decent headset if you re using it for pc gaming there is no noise cancelation the loudest volume is not that loud to be honest the led lights needs the usb to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller you can use it for playstation or xbox but you can use led unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with usb port guess should have expected this since it wasn too expensive although for this product think the price is lot this is equivalent to dollar headset based on sound quality no noise cancelation and the led lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you re playing on playstation ,128,3.0
15675,sounds great long battery,4,5.0
8881,i love this keyboard love that it wireless it came charged so plugged it into my child computer and they were able to use it right away love that it fairly quiet typing the backlight goes off quickly which think is good because it saves battery the one thing personally don like is the placement of the return key and the backslash key used to the backslash key being above the return and the return key being more horizontal super small detail that is taking time for me to get used to but would still recommend this keyboard because it great overall ,102,5.0

17050,i ve taken this thing on the go for few months now and it great speaker purchased it to replace my stolen charge the quality is very good for most genres and the bass is something to appreciate the battery life is outstanding sometimes forget to turn it off disabled the power sounds for it and it easier to forget now and it will last days of just being on it very portable as long as you have decent sized bag to carry it in used my backpack very good purchase ,91,5.0

11443,not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way if your buying for xbox or playstation it terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol without plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use the sound quality okay for the price ,58,5.0

4492,i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one ,83,5.0

17136,very good,2,2.0
4759,i loved this product when first received it it lit up and lightweight and just pretty but that was very short lived it stopped working after just weeks of using it good thing it was on the cheaper side maybe it was disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for short period ,53,5.0

4052,simply put it is great mouse for what it worth however had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the usb adapter that comes with the product have ports the manual grammar is terrible btw tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them none of them worked which was bummer then tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away the adapter they provide you is just useless so if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook you should get separate adapter once connected it though it seemed to work perfectly smooth tracking silent clicks and the rgb lighting is beautiful just got it today so hopefully it will keep working the way they claim it should work ,135,5.0

15005,speaker crackles and can hear music clear ,7,5.0
9690,really cool keyboard the rainbow lights look awesome like that they turn off on automatically while in use to avoid draining battery faster can speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it just for personal use and not heavy gaming or regular work use the charging cable is short for my liking prefer to plug it into an adapter and not the computer for efficient charging the feel of the keys is nice they press easily but not too easily typing is quiet the keyboard is very lightweight which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use it also fairly compact for full keyboard so it nice it doesn take up much space ,140,5.0

4347,i am college student so naturally need mouse that lights up the picture made the mouse look so cool with the lights but the white mouse ordered was more of transparent white so the lights made the mouse look like something bought at swap meet super cheap now for the function it worked great for few months then the sensor on the bottom started to get an attitude with me wanted to go to the right of my screen and it would want to go left attempted to perform an exorcism on it just in case there was demon possessing it either did it wrong or the demon was too powerful for my faith or the mouse is malfunctioning ll let you decide the storyline on that one prior to it becoming possessed it worked great and charged up fast the charger is old school not usb ,147,3.0

6809,the battery of this mouse works well haven timed it but have left it on overnight and it stills has battery not gamer but imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the pc setup recently switched from laptop that had the standard rectangular port usb to one that needed the adapter usb the adapter that comes with the mouse worked for about minute before it stop functioning so brought out my own adapter from different device and the mouse now works also tested both adapters with wired mouse it suffices to say that it was the mouse adapter that is not working could have gotten faulty one so the problem could be exclusive to me tl dr mouse adapter didn work ur screwed if urs doesn work either and don have an extra one ,146,1.0

10460,keep in mind this is my first bengoo headset so assume it rare case however this was not great first impression was using it on my pc but it probably works best as console headset the headset itself looks great the speaker sounds nice and love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mic buttons on the cable as well unfortunately that all positive comments can give the setup app did not connect to the headset no matter if enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to reset not only that it takes attempts to open the app needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it then it didn even recognize the headset at all no options to configure or anything trying to use another app for the setup was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports when finally got connected to the mic was greeted with the sound of rain like static that was louder than my own voice volume the volume of the mic itself was so low needed to increase it to the maximum value it also has default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable was hoping to replace my pc gaming headset but can say feel confident buying this one ,223,4.0

1377,i have been using this mouse for weeks now and have no complaints it goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with click no delays or problems connecting to bluetooth do wish had way to know what the battery life was but just hook it up every days and it hasn died on me yet ,59,1.0
1455,this mouse has low profile which fits my hand perfectly the point glides smoothly over the screen haven seen any difference in pointer speed between the three dpi settings but it doesn matter because it is fast enough can say enough good things about the fact that this mouse is rechargeable but have been using it daily for about week and it shows no sign of running down or needing recharging the kaleidoscope effect of changing colors is cool makes me want to turn out the lights and use the computer in darkened room would definitely recommend this mouse ,99,5.0

4405,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider ,170,1.0

15599,the aux on the jbl charge is poorly designed the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is delay extended silence or short period of low volume section causing parts of the song to missed for few seconds while it tries to turn back on this creates interruptions if you are trying to listen to yoga or meditative music or podcasts have two of them with the latest firmware and they both have this issue it appears many others have already commented on this issue apparently this was an intentional design by jbl to save power but it defeats the purpose of the aux port the bluetooth range and party range is mediocre you can leave the room with your phone or it will cut out ,129,2.0

7514,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue ,125,5.0
1257,i have had this mouse for almost months and use it at least hours day haven been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging but in the time have had it have only had to charge it times and was able to continue to use it while charging do use it for gaming but my games don require fast and accurate like rpg etc so can say yes it does gaming for me but unsure about speed games pros it slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it not ergonomically built and it fits nicely in my carry case the colors are soothing you have options for either standard usb or usb for chargingthe cons the on off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole you need nails or stylus to turn it on the sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it skates over the pad good shake usually gets it right all in all it priced reasonably for what you get update like everyone else just few days past the day return cutoff my mouse also died no power wouldn charge dead contacted the manufacturer mototo inc and they said they have year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out new one ,225,1.0

11662,i bought these because play rpgs via discord and wanted better mic than my galaxy buds because sometimes they don pick up my voice from the very first night used this headset people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mic it was quite distracting and ended up having to switch to my earbuds thought that was weird maybe just problem with discord but would try some solutions and see if could get them to work used them little since then and no one said anything but kept myself muted unless was actually speaking then my boyfriend complained about hearing youtube through the mic to the point where it was very loud for him when could barely hear the video myself wondered if it might be my macbook pro did some research to see if there was setting could change or anything else to fix the problem nothing did then thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews after reading them convinced the headset has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around starting the process of returning them through amazon because don have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction bring on the cash offers but this review is going nowhere ,224,5.0

7944,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse ,96,5.0

9276,this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garbage it makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still lags ,58,3.0

17015,i ve been around music my entire life including spinning records at top nightclubs where jbl was the speaker of choice really wanted to love this speaker but it not happening jbl should be ashamed of themselves the sound quality is horrible the speaker clips at between and of the volume using my phone at way the speaker music coming out is missing everything including clarity bass treble yes stereo everyone with reviews complaining about dead music coming out is absolutely correct the speaker plays dead music especially at higher volumes anyone wanting cheap portable speaker with horrible sound this is for you anyone looking for great speaker this is not for you yes you get what you pay for but with today technology every speaker should sound great take look at the marshall bluetooth speakers they re amazing also if you don need portability the klipsch speakers are amazing sonos is overrated find myself always going back to the good old names from decades ago even the bose speaker selling for around on sale right now at bb sounds better than these jbl speakers folks take look at the bose marshall bt speakers you ll really enjoy the sound especially from the marshall woburn ii have the bose soundtouch the speaker blows away every speaker on the market also had the marshall stanmore hooked up to my phone and computer it rocked if you can find the old bose acoustic wave in mint condition that was once an amazing speaker too hope this review helps you thanks for reading it ,261,5.0

16221,the speaker connected to my phone right away however it was very difficult to connect it to alexa and it didn work very smoothly had to go into the app to reconnect every time wanted to use it the main problem however is that it wouldn connect at all to the jbl app contacted customer service and they suggested resetting the speaker and explained how to do this followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off success except not so much now the speaker won turn on at all hoping this is just defective device and when return it and receive my new one it will work much better if so will rate it again in more positive light added note once again was able to contact jbl customer service and they got the device working again it works perfectly except it still won connect to the jbl app after reading reviews of the app this is clearly failure of the app not the speaker love the speaker gave instead of only because of the problem with the jbl app ,189,5.0

9163,pros everything about this keyboard is really good the keys are super quiet like advertised my pc gaming setup is right next to our bed so if play at night when my wife is sleeping it does not wake her up because how silent the keys are the rgb light brightness controls are awesome too again allows me to keep the keyboard bright enough to see in dark without blinding me or my wife while she sleeps if game at night the color tones of the rgb lights are very nice pleasing to look at cons the keys feel sticky with every press feels as if there was sticky substance holding down the keys for fraction of second when depressed but only little not too big of deal but some gamers might find this very annoying there are only two rgb light options to choose from breathing effect and constant back lite would be nice if there were more lighting effect options ,162,5.0

9068,this is good looking keyboard the rainbow colors you see are all you can get so no selection of one color is available although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice not critical issue as said it nice looking keyboard but functionally there are couple of issues that are immediately apparent first the enter key as in the picture attached has notch in it that is shared with the key am constantly hitting the and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages so at minimum it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone another issue seems to be battery life instructions indicate hours to charge can accept that what can accept is the life of the battery after in the short time have had this keyboard it has died on my twice within day of getting full charge so sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life so now am keeping it wired with the provided cable because cannot be without keyboard when it dies and plugging it into power source is not enough once the battery is dead it will not power up until it has gotten enough of charge to respond but connected to the pc via usb cable makes it online instantly overall poor technical design my only other complaint and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to mechanical desktop keyboard again but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy but while writing this review took moment to look closer the keys on this keyboard are probably good smaller surface area than either laptop typically use this adds to the closeness of the keys and why am constantly off key here and there typing as normally do by feel alone square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable this is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back ,340,5.0

9502,i love the back lighting rechargeable battery and light personally only sit at desk when playing games mostly like wireless so don have to sit at flat surface for the keyboard use like to sit back from my computer on inch monitor tv for emails you tube videos and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing websites your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and typing with the right the keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have spot to use thumb to hold without touching key little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the esc key an another model perhaps flared out going to the top ,138,5.0

6870,within minutes of plugging the new rechargeable mouse into usb hub charger thankfully it wasn plugged into my daughter brand new laptop she just opened for her birthday my house started to smell like smoke and found the charging cable melting to the mouse in the drawer just put them in to pre charge if this had happened at night my house would have probably caught fire do not buy fire hazard dangerous,73,1.0

11782,this product is marketed on amazon as being compatible with ps but the usb it uses is incompatible with the console due to gimmicky aesthetic design choices that make it too large to fit past the playstations protruding faceplate ,39,5.0
9126,i like the back lit keys but the keyboard has really short battery life we have to charge it few times week and we do not use it all day ,30,5.0
1782,i bought this product in november by december the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped ll admit liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again here we are in february and the same exact thing has happened again used this mouse for my work computer in the office and certainly don aggressively use the scroll wheel yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units both within the first weeks of use ve never had mouse break apart like this before so have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together suppose you get what you pay for shame because aesthetically it is very nice will never buy this product again would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away pay few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than few weeks side note look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review rolls eyes perhaps ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha,190,5.0
15475,i feel like see this speaker everywhere and it great speaker super loud and great quality for the size price no complaints there have main issues too much bass think it crazy to say for speaker like this but it true sounds great for some songs too muddy in others don need eq settings but bass boost on off would be nice there no way to go back one song with the speaker controls this is legitimately frustrating ve read the manual and googled it but the controls let you adjust volume play pause and skip to the next song can go back and replay song without going back to my phone to control it ,115,1.0

6238,if you are like me and have trouble using usb to usb converters somehow always end up with flaky ones that don maintain connection be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support usb it comes with usb and usb adapter however you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter to use it you cannot use the usb adapter on its own which means have long double adapter sticking out of my computer just waiting to get knocked off had known up front that the usb adapter required the usb adapter to work would not have made this purchase ,103,2.0

9313,a solid keyboard for the price the battery life is not very good and if you use your computer lot it sort of defeats the purpose of it being wireless the keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboards the backlighting provides nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on single charge however the light level makes the keys very visible in dark or dimly lit room if the rgbs are important to you consider keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off on and glow with options to toggle light level and glow frequency ,106,3.0

7739,the mouse is contained in japanese package but was made in china it comes with the type adapter charging usb cable regular usb mouse receiver and thin instructions ve plugged the type adapter into two different machines with the same result neither laptops read the type directly or through another adapter ve also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type with the same results none of them work through this adapter other than that issue the mouse works it also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again the also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included just plug in the charging cord into an empty usb slot the color changing around the rim of the mouse gives nice touch and although at first the mouse feels long due to it sleek shape it does fit comfortably in the hand it also has plastic like feeling and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn malfunction or break ,176,5.0
8852,well it was good while it lasted for year but will never buy an off brand wireless gaming keyboard again battery sucks on this keyboard had to charge it at least once week it was so annoying that just left the cable on the keyboard which defy the purpose of getting wireless keyboard then the keyboard would start having weird behavior it would freeze up or if type it would get stuck on letter and repeat it times so done with this junk fyi rarely used this keyboard for gaming only use it for everything web surfing need the illuminated light cause my work space is dark ,107,1.0

10343,so it cancels most noise out but other people on microphone complain about all my background noise being too loud ,20,4.0
1848,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review ,246,5.0
10776,my last headset lasted me years and finally died on me orded this one thinking it looked good first off the mic isnt curvable to so cant put it closer to my face and its to far so now its half way on my ear so can move it closer to my mouth my friends can still barely hear me when im not speaking loudly and this is problem since have year old that sleeps near me ive also listened to myself and sound like im inside of can the only postive could find is that its really comfy and the sound quality is ok ill be sending this back tomorrow and ordering another rig headset since they clearly understand whats needed to make good gaming headset ,127,5.0

6246,and it only wireless half the time the other half you ll have it plugged in and charging because charge doesn last very long that why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse that makes it hard to use when charging everyone knows it easier to drag chain up hill than to push it up well everyone but these people update the battery has completely gone dead it won even take charge anymore after only three months you have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast you have to wait to seconds for it to charge just so you can use it for another seconds it even worse than the star rating gave it originally ,143,1.0
9664,when turned it on and the back lights appeared in beautiful rainbow pattern was blown away it is such nice keyboard am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt what love best about the product is everything really the keys are soft and comfortable with the exception of the space key love how quiet these keys are can type discreetly without being too loud love that the lighting is adjustable both in pattern and brightness the breathing mode is very neat feature and like that can adjust the speed of it it has calming effect but also like that can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if don want them on the wireless feature is neat because can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don have to worry about plugging it in like the little legs on the bottom so can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if want it to be more or less ergonomic the battery display is great feature because can tell when need to plug it in before it loses power also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use on the instructions pamphlet at the very end it says thinks for reading it should say thanks for reading it obvious that great care was taken to create high quality product so it disappointing to see such careless error one other thing don care for is how loud the space bar is all the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make sound but when tap the space bar it makes loud plastic sound that seems to resonate throughout the room for how often it gets used was hoping it would be bit quieter other than those two things wouldn change anything this product is very easy to use the instructions were incredibly helpful and well written it nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages it gives the impression that this is worldwide company and because of that very successful it gives the company lot of credibility the instructions were easy to read and follow like that the function keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard absolutely love this keyboard and would recommend it to all of my friends whether you have laptop or desktop computer this keyboard is not only great to look at it works very well there is an incredible value for the money here have several klim products in my office and love each one am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again ,470,5.0

6567,i will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it ergonomics feels good in my hand at first but after few minutes you start to realize something is off it little too small for extended use but hey that personal preference for the couple hours did use this thing the sleep mode worked did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up netflix and hulu was nightmare the quiet click is top notch give that outta so ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for little bit they might twitch little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn being used but this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always use split screen and open netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right when move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left it also lags every once in while and sometimes you put the mouse over something leave it there for second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on rows above where was this was on netflix this is nightmare of mouse do not buy its cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option you can buy cheaper mouse that functions properly the led lights did work just fine for me the next morning went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until can get another one ,273,1.0

12658,pros games sound nice and loud without any distortion cheap but good great first time gaming head set comfortable even when playing for four or more hours cons no noise canceling large and somewhat cumbersome cord is long and thick so if you have it plugged into ps or ps controller it is annoyingly in the way usb connector for the led lights is also annoying not even sure what the lights are for anyway you can see them when wearing the headset unless you play in front of mirrior good cheap entry level headset my first one it is comfortable and lightweight but feels reasonably sturdy sound is nice an loud crisp but not lot of bass would definitely recommend for the casual gamer like myself microphone is omnidirectional and pretty sensitive so keep that in mind if you are playing in noisy environment ,145,5.0

4097,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer ,247,1.0

10053,this product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect while it states that it is compatible with the nintendo switch and box one systems the microphone is not compatible with either unless you pay and extra for an adapter to make the microphone work the worst thing though is the return window you have like weeks to return it then you are stuck with it spent two weeks trying to get it to work and figuring out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapter now am stuck with these useless things very very disappointing it is definitely worth it to pay more money for better product that is actually compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with ,125,1.0

10290,constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone this product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap mm design with no qc over it the sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound maybe you can get lucky and get headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even little bump here or there will easily knock it off place good luck taking your chances with this product ,88,5.0

8409,when received there was mystery liquid on the number pad chose to assume maybe it was cleaning fluid of some sort wiped it off and moved on with my life its supposedly water proof per advertisement right keyboard works fine while plugged in and has quiet keys but will not hold charge advertised as bluetooth and has bluetooth connector but only working as wired keyboard at this point and the backlight is super dim even at the highest brightness maybe mine was faulty but personally do not recommend ,88,3.0

11852,i ve had this headset for couple weeks so far say it is working very well sound quality is good there is no active noise cancellation but don feel that it would be necessary can hear everything clearly without turning the volume up too high the higher you go the more distortion you will hear as expected at first wasn getting the microphone to work unplugged the splitter from the single mm aux plug and re connected it after plugging both audio cables from the splitter in again everything worked as intended for those who aren familiar make sure the pink connector goes into the microphone port and green goes into the headset port this review is based on using the headset on pc have not tried using it with anything else at this time also there is toggle switch next to the volume dial on the headset make sure it is switched on microphone symbol without line through it if you plan to use the microphone overall would recommend this headset it is priced very reasonably and it meets my needs ,182,5.0
1267,it broke within days of having this mouse accidentally dropped it as was picking up the mouse and my computer it cannot sustain fall from less than feet definitely did enjoy it for the days had it ,37,2.0
15700,i live in the country and host or go to lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings we discovered while ago that having radio wasn good enough between lack of music selection and constant commercials the jbl charge is perfect party speaker solution and going to leave my impressions based on that use the speaker is plenty loud if you re on deck patio and it placed several feet away you ll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation it doesn do as well at our large outdoor fire pit because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in that space is about feet from bench on one side of the fire pit to the other and in an open yard the speaker is still good just not great if you like loud commanding music as do if there is larger group of people like speaking at once for example it will not be able to overtake their voices and will be reduced to background music it will also be affected by big bonfire the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire the sound clarity is good bass is nothing crazy but tight and does not distort or sound hollow as noted earlier volume really depends on how small space you re using it in and how many people are talking but even in the big open outdoor area it perfectly loud with only few people most importantly when turned all the way up it maintains clear clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems speakers do when you push them see some complaints about it being mono speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is if want unparalleled sound eq customization and other features ll buy true audiophile equipment bluetooth is easy to connect and lifesaver technology in general if you have cellphone with enough bars and this speaker you can play as much music as you want bluetooth will stay connected at good distance ve walked about feet from the speaker and had no issues not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker imagine but it will tolerate reasonable distance charge time is definitely optimistic it advertised as being hours but ve not gotten close to that fully charged and playing continuously at full volume connected via bluetooth ve squeezed probably hours out of it which is still plenty often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music the speaker is definitely waterproof ve left it outside in the rain couple of times also let it sit on plastic chair with recess on the bottom it rained overnight and came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in puddle of water where it had sat for hours powered right up with no issues glad tested its abilities but hate to abuse neglect any of my stuff like that if you re doing something similar to me gathering several friends around chimenea on the patio or sitting out back by the fire pit this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cranked up if you re looking to entertain large group of people who are going to be noisy it not the best choice but who really listening at that point anyway ,571,1.0

8278,first off this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price at first the keys were bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press but as typed more on it they loosened up and now feel great the keys feel clicky but soft enough where it not loud to type the space bar is bit louder but not as loud compared to other keyboards works great as an external keyboard for my windows and mac laptops do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it not as bright when the room light is on also it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboards that are around the same price range or cheaper lastly it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the fn key for macs on my macbook pro with mojave was able to change the settings to where the ctrl key functions as the command key on mac you simply go to system preferences keyboard modifier keys and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to select keyboard for me it was wireless receiver once the correct keyboard is selected changed the control key to command and changed the command key to control now the ctrl key functions as the command key however the windows key functions as the command key by default so these steps are not necessary if you re okay using the windows key overall would recommend it if you re on budget and don mind some of the drawbacks mentioned still great keyboard and battery life is pretty good ,287,4.0

3882,i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand the only downside is that the right click has tendency to stick even when am only using the left click ve had it for few days now and that the only negative ,51,5.0
13149,these work well and the sound quality is good they completely cover the ears and seem to be comfortable enough they rest on the pad on top of the head and would probably get tired of that with extended wear but overall they are good product at good price ,49,5.0
10796,for gaming and even for non gaming gripe have about this headset is the volume and mic controller it like you have remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair the usb cable is also an annoying addition it cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don need to waste the energy for the lights it an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop so the design could definitely be better as for the noise cancellation not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have tested the mic and even with the mic all the way up you have to manually mute yourself using the volume controller otherwise people can still hear you but you will seem like you re far away from the computer the sound quality is okay played games and watched movies with these while watching shows movies with just the aux mm jack did notice some voice echoing this isn super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this the headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears these might be more of on ear headphones rather than over ear ones the cushion does eventually hurt to keep the headset on for an extended period of time but hoping after wearing the cushion down bit the comfortability will increase overall the headset is okay since got it on sale it decent set of headphones ,268,5.0

1038,great mouse nothing super fancy comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary plugged in to different computers and worked immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent price will update if anything changes,89,2.0

7180,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer ,279,5.0
15842,i bought this speaker days ago from this comment date used it with its initial charge worked well then tried to charge it it never charged saw many similar problems about this speaker on reviews some faced this issue after month and they can return it happy that it happened within days won trust this brand anymore ,57,5.0

800,this mouse worked well for about months then it stopped holding charge even tethered to the laptop it was not working well but why buy wireless mouse if it needs to be used wired and why use wired mouse if it doesn even work don waste your money ll go pull out my ancient wired mouse that works ,58,1.0
5424,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power ,360,2.0

15953,where to start purchased this to use at an upcoming bbq pool party we were having with approximately guest when it first arrived fully charged it no wall charger included connected to bluetooth it was working fine for the short time used it the day of our party it would play for short time and stop but was showing it was connected to bluetooth it was very frustrating having to stop what we were doing to try to figure out the cause never figured it out the sound quality was subpar lacked in bass and at times distorted the overall sound was mono not what you would expect for the price and an upgraded model also you will not receive any of your phone notifications when using the speaker so you need to keep your phone with you we ended up having to use an old bose speaker so our guest would have continuous music without the constant interruption would not recommend the charge couple of our friends own the charge and it sounds and preforms much better than the returned,181,5.0

9852,for the price you re getting something better than most other expensive headsets do want to say that the people who can get the mic to work need to stop using the splitter that thing is for older tower pc that use pair of ports one for the output and one for the input can use these on my laptop pc and use the mic fine without the splitter ,69,5.0
8824,likes works good for the price and is pretty good for membrane keyboard the battery seems to last quite long time didn actually time it the keyboard goes to sleep pretty fast to conserve battery life also can be con cons this is why it is cheap so the cons are to be expected for keyboard at this price point the keyboard flexes the rgb is very limited would of liked an option for solid color the keyboard shuts off even when plugged in probably the biggest downside the space bar is clacky and doesn feel as solid as the other keys if you want decent keyboard that is fairly cheap and works as advertised this isn bad buy ,119,4.0

1013,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked don feel as though this will be adequate for long term gaming but it ll be alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the price couldn ask for much more but do think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reviews you have to connect the receiver to the adapter it takes good bit of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve been more clear about that but it whatever ,113,5.0
13091,i used this headset with my xbox one got it for on black friday deal which was nice though guess got what paid for was lured in little by the led lights and was bit disappointed to find out wouldn be able to use them since they only activate when connected to pc the sound quality was as expected for headset wasn amazing but was by no means terrible the ear cuffs are definitely noise blocking and they re surprisingly comfortable to wear even if you wear glasses since wear glasses most headsets start to hurt my ears after while but experienced no pain with this one the mic was okay never really had any problems with it did have slight problems with the volume control though sometimes it would catch rub on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down wasn that big of an issue though since it rarely happened say my only valid complaint was the letdown of only having it for months before it died was really excited about this headset the whole reason bought it was so could get something that would last me bit longer than cheap headset would but it barely lasted me four months what even worse is that still currently have headset that has lasted longer and someone who takes care of all things electronic and electronic related so this was the result of the actual headset failing might have given it or stars had it been of use for just little while longer ,255,3.0

7,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider ,170,1.0
8276,i like the keyboard for all of its features except for one the enter key it difficult to touch type due to the weird shape of the key keep hitting the backslash key when really want to hit the enter key normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key this won be problem for those who don touch type but for those of us who do it an impossible reach when trying to fly at words per minute for this reason don recommend this particular keyboard going to be looking for new keyboard ,101,5.0

11350,this is great for beginner gamers the headset is comfy which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headaches from the pressure it does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear bit which prefer since would like to know if being spoken to when playing but you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room like that you can use in the pc and ps because the headset jack works with the ps remotes like others mentioned the usb has to be connected to light up for us we don mind the light not being lit up so it not big issue after all when you are the user you really don look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare only issue had which isn big issue is the mute for the mic isn easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gaming for those times when you want to be muted so others don hear every background noise or family talking so find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing fps games and in an intense section but that might be me not able to multitask that quickly lol just wished the mute button was button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren stumbling trying to slide plus it doesn really feel like it slides all the way so you are double checking know went into depth of the issue but it isn huge issue just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration overall love it going to buy couple more for our gaming family ,309,2.0

14380,sounds good but so many of these companies spend more budget on marketing spinners rather than solid honest technology the talk of of these producing stereo via the app may or may not be true don mind buying two but this intentional vagueness really sucks we need more engineers and less marketers in this world engineers with budgets build good stuff marketers dance and hide stuff no mic for phone calls will update when abd if find the time to unravel the intentional fog others seem to have plenty of comments which may have good info happy with the mono sound so far will keep for now ,107,5.0

10838,upon receiving these was so excited to see these lit up while use them to game on my xbox the design of them is bisually appealing upon unboxing the pink looked little cheap but sure the other colors with black would have been better was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into usb which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short so that was big after being bummed about that shrugged it off and started gaming with them anyway got minutes into my game when sound started breaking up another minutes later and they completely stopped working tested my old headset just to be sure and the old worked verifying the headset was junk sending back and paying the extra for turtle beach ,144,5.0

17244,my brother has pair of jbl extremes and they sound great outdoors didn want to go that big and expensive so after some research purchased pair of charge one from amazon with points and one from meijer store at big discount knew that separately they are mono but planned on getting two paired them with my iphone downloaded the connect app and tried them out in my breezeway and wasn terribly impressed but that room has cedar walls and ceiling and all hard furniture so moved out to the patio incredible sound played some aaron diehl tom waits jade bird several genres exceeded my expectations after listening to just one speaker would say this might not be what you want if you re going to use one solo would probably consider the charge in that case but if you connect at least two speakers for stereo sound you won be disappointed ,151,5.0

8331,this keyboard is decent it types well has good tactile response and an easy to adjust to layout in addition the rgb backlight works great and looks good minor flaw the flip out legs to prop the keyboard to more ergonomic position tend to close easily from the pressure of typing or gaming minor flaw if you type all day and game all night this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all day activity is relatively short have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my wireless mouse of different brand major flaw given that battery life is not where would like it to be the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low you are typing or gaming and the keyboard suddenly becomes non responsive because the battery is suddenly dead of course quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord but incredibly annoying and inconvenient overall decent keyboard but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my avatar when gaming pretty lights though ,217,1.0

12755,i not much of gamer but got these for work conference calls because my computer mic is terrible the first thing noticed is that they felt like they were made with cheap plastic the ear cushions are super stiff and they don seem to get worn in after using them even though don game too much still have some multi hour sessions on gta at night and use these so dont wake up my house the sound is good but the ear cushions really start hurting my ears after prolonged usage if you re looking for comfort go elsewhere the overall sound is good not great absolutely no noise cancelling functions ,111,3.0
12102,these things are awesome paid don use them for gaming so no rating but the sound quality is so good the only problem is they don adjust any smaller and rest bit heavy on my head they do have cushion though so that helps and my ears are completely covered ,50,3.0

10930,i am by no means headset snob have some specifications that want met for gaming headset these headphones check lot of boxes but not all of them unfortunately will be looking for new headset because the microphone is pretty muffled am in party chat days week my friends have stated that the mic is muffled and kind of muddy louder sounds make their way through the mic for example gunshots loud animal calls in hunting game loud screams effects from scary game etc the mic is fixed this is obvious with the photos but didn realize how much it would effect me can adjust how close or far the mic is from my mouth and therefore can really try to fix mic quality the plastic quality is ehh it feels little cheaper but you get what you re paying for with budget headset the bass was not all that impressive have had lot worse but also much better as well say it bass rating and this is one of the most important features for me everything else about the headset is great but don recommend it for gaming with friends their best features include long braided cord crisp loud and powerful sound comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs great designcons fixed mic bad mic quality not best for really small losing sound quality or really large losing comfort head lacking amazing bass,233,1.0

16166,whereas on the charge the bass gets bit overwhelming on the charge the bass feels non existant by comparison further sound on the charge is less clear than on the charge details in your music get off faint notes disappear although the bass on the charge could be overwhelming the overall sound quality was much better further the charge is heavier bulkier than the charge despite less functionality on the charge could make phone calls but there is no calling ability on the charge if the charge upgraded its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices would trash the charge and go back to the charge the only improvement on the charge over the charge is that the power button is bit easier to press ,127,4.0
3239,the mouse worked great loved it actually but the charging cord is severed and while it does charge it also will shock you little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in and because the charging cord is only inches hard to refrain from touching where it is severed will stop using this when new different mouse arrives ,65,1.0
7908,great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again,70,5.0

2318,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it ,273,1.0

17332,i bought this because wanted to get good bluetooth speaker and debated between this and the ue boom because they are about the same price after doing little research figured that the jbl would sound better and surprised the jbl sounds really good good bass at low volumes great mids and highs for portable speaker it does distort slightly when you get bass heavy song using spotify built in eq with bass boost but nothing little eq can solve it turns the bass down when you are close to max volume to protect itself which is nice and it still sounds decent at max volume range is awesome can walk about feet away before it starts cutting out hopefully it lasts will update review if it breaks from normal use or anything like that but so far so good ,139,5.0

7386,i was looking for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the click is very quiet yet there is satisfying tactile feel to it though the right click can be bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be used while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging the mouse will also go into sleep mode after minutes of inactivity to save power overall great mouse ,116,5.0

8283,this is my third klim keyboard loved the first they changed something on the design because the space bar is terrible now doesn work if off center at all ,29,1.0
8481,at first glance the keyboard looks and feels nice the keys are decently silent though very loud compared to my other low profile minimalistic keyboard and the rgb is cool however there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use the function key is on the right side of the spacebar which is non standard so very weird to use keyboard shortcuts like ctrl shift for dev tools in chrome am programmer only works on the right side of the keyboard not the left which used to and works on every other keyboard ve ever used and the issue cannot be fixed with the klim reset keyboard combo so you re stuck with the issue the rgb is somewhat faint and even on the static setting doesn stay on it dims after not very long at all of inactivity making me have to constantly type to keep it onoverall would save your money you could get much better keyboard for the same price that doesn have the glitches or annoyances honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that klim continues to sell known defective product without offering returns what sham ,196,2.0

2147,okay understood that having mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life just didn expect this the mouse seems to have no sleep mode the lights stay on unless it completely switched off and the battery lasts less than two days brand new thought to myself that could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night because do like how the mouse feels and works except last night plugged it in and this morning hours later it wasn done charging have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it which kind of defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse in the first place and ties up two usb ports instead of just one shame back to the drawing board on my mouse search ,138,5.0

7544,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries ,143,5.0

4174,is almost tiny for my hands and very light works so good and decently priced ll learn to use it for surfing the web yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle think holding it in the past ve had taller models that have flair formed to keep the fingers in position in construction using stuff that requires good grip makes this like using feather barely feel makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make lot fast moves elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good may even make flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down it is cool with the lights no joke good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control lol yet thank you found another fun product on amazon again ,199,1.0
160,mine stopped working it doesn work on mouse pad and freezes when use it on top of flat surface ,19,5.0
9116, updated after five months of use the keyboard suddenly died for no reason tried all troubleshooting could and it just doesn turn on turns on for about half second and turns back off guess you get what you pay for doesn last long whatsoever original review had been looking for wireless gaming keyboard that wasn loud and had backlighting it not the perfect keyboard and didn expect it to with that price the two things would change in their second version would be to make the rgb bit more versatile or customizable to save little on battery and make the keys feel little more clicky because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes overall love the weight its durability and slick look knocked it for two things but they are picky at this point ,136,2.0

14766,so originally was introduced to jbl speakers when the care first come out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been relation any and everyone come across that when ever in doubt go with jbl so this last Christmas person baught me the jbl somersault and was just confused the audio timbre the foundation even the bluetooth association would kick me off about every one-third birdcall returned no trouble only desire surrogate anyway received the second one and again like the jbl expression and spirit was there but the sound timbre especially the foundation was just miss was disappointed think that the caller just dived after the care so after getting refund from the second somersault spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the audio that made me sports_fan to begin with if you re just try out jbl speakers would recommend outgo just the few extra dollars for the care models see that the somersault and have almost perfect evaluation on amazon so maybe it just my public_opinion but think the measure all around of the care is better spokesperson of the jbl trade_name the barrage in the care seems to drain quicker than the somersault but put my loudspeaker throw it passes from the here_and_now turn it on in the good_morning until am ready to relax in the flush literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth association no trouble at all the audio timbre is just awesome love music time_period think music is the best and purist manner to control_condition moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically listen to anything from Gospel to heavy metallic_element blues state blame etc have noticed that if the music being listened to be heavy in foundation the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the bulk maybe or pushes of the push_button if you re listening to sax or blues guitar albert baron for model it only gets better the higher you Adam garth brooks or lauren daigle just over half manner of bulk and the vocals and piano will be front and center_field and so on even at just little more than half manner more than what you would need in the back patio or thousand serviceman can delay public_treasury can become enough for the extreme_point or the smash corner hope this was helpful to person God consecrate,402,5.0
